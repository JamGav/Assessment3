            <h1>Autonomous Vehicles</h1>
			<p class="authorship">Written by Kyle Ross, Rory Henderson, Evan Phelps</p>
            <h3>What does it do?</h3>
            <p>Autonomous Vehicles (AV) are vehicles that have the capability to drive themselves with minimal to no human input. For many years, this technology has been thought of as a technology of the future, however, technological advancements in other fields such as Artificial Intelligence, GPS, LIDAR  (Light detection and ranging) and more have brought the reality of Autonomous Vehicles closer to our present with each day. Currently, self-driving functionality can be used by specific cars, with an example being Teslas Auto-Pilot.</p>
                <p>Autonomous Vehicles construct a map of their surrounding environments using a combination of Realtime sensors such as GPS for journey planning and location relevant information, radars that monitor the position of nearby objects, cameras that identify traffic lights, signs, and pedestrians and more (What is an Autonomous Car? – How Self-Driving Cars Work | Synopsys, n.d.). Autonomous Vehicles use this collected data and run it through Engineering Algorithms and AI to map their location, perceive what is around them, predict what each of these objects will do and then plan what it will do next to reach its destination (National Association of City Transportation Offcials, 2019).</p>

            </div>
            <h4>Where does this technology currently stand?</h4>
            <p>When discussing AV’s and their level of automation the Society of Automotive Engineers use 6 levels (Path to Autonomy: Self-Driving Car Levels 0 to 5 Explained, 2017). There are:</p>

                <p><b>0-No Automation.</b> A human driver is fully responsible for all controls; steering, brakes, acceleration, etc.</p>

                <p><b>1-Drive Assistance.</b> The car controls speed or steering in some situations. This level of automation requires the driver to perform all other aspects of driving and leaves the driver the responsibility to take over if the automation fails.</p>

                <p><b>2-Partial Automation.</b> The car can steer, accelerate and brake in certain circumstances. The driver will need to perform “Tactical maneuvers” (Traffic signals, changing lanes) and will often need to keep their hand on the wheel as a safety feature.</p>

                <p><b>3-Conditional Automation.</b> The car can manage most aspects of driving (including environmental monitoring) but the driver must be available and ready to take over if the car has an issue.</p>

                <p><b>4-High Automation.</b> The car can drive without human input under specific road conditions or geographical region. There can still be controls (pedals, steering wheel) and the driver can have the ability to take over, but this isn’t necessary.</p>

                <p><b>5-Full automation.</b> The car can drive on any surface (that a human could drive). Currently it doesn’t exist but is the goal of many manufacturers.</p>

                <p>Currently, Autonomous Vehicles (AV) have the ability to self-drive in certain cities and areas of North America, where development of this technology is heavily focused. Human intervention is still something that must occur when operating these self-driving vehicles, as the technology is not yet developed enough for drivers to rely on the automation.This puts the current leading vehicles in level 3-Conditional Automation with Tesla’s Model 3 often topping the list of cars with self-driving capabilities (heycar editorial team, 2021).</p>

                Tesla’s Model 3 in some situations can be classed as having Level 4 automation with the Enhanced Auto-Pilot feature allowing the car to park with no human input.</p>

                <p>Crucially, it must be noted that the marketing and advertising surrounding "autonomous vehicles" could, in itself, be considered very misleading just from using that term. Despite the sales pitch, no self-driving car is yet truly autonomous. They still require very alert human failsafes, especially on more dangerous roads and unpredictable conditions, yet many of those who would purchase such a car can find themselves mislead into believing otherwise - with quite disastrous results. "In one crash report, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) referred to it as “automation complacency”." (Associated Press, theguardian.com)</p>

                    <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d6tgmGqXysM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                 </div>
                <h4>What is the future of this technology?</h4>
            <p>AV’s are developing rapidly and are seeing heavy investment from car manufacturers and tech giants (Anand, 2021). Looking at Tesla, the current leader in the consumer market for AV’s, their technology has evolved from Level 0 Automation in 2014, pre their first Auto Pilot release (Evannex, 2018) to now supporting up to level 4 in consumer applications. We can expect to see other manufactures meet and surpass Tesla's current offering within the next few years. </p>

            <p>ABI Research forecast that 8 million consumer vehicles will be equipped with Self driving features in Automation levels 3 and 4 in the consumer market by 2025. However the National Association of city Transportation officials predict that if every new vehicle purchased today were fully automated, it would take at least two decades for AVs to make up ninety percent of the vehicles on the road(National Association of City Transportation Offcials, 2019).</p>

            <p>In the future, the expected goal is to be able to perform otherhigher levels of Automation will allow other activities such as working, reading or sleeping while the car drives the passengers to the intended destination.</p>
            <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
            <p>The positive attributes Autonomous Vehicles and self-driving cars can bring forward are plentiful,but with that being said, the aspect of robotic error is something we must then consider, could these cars bring more problems and harm than they solve?</p>
            <p>Autonomous Vehicles can offer significant safety gains when they reach higher levels of automation. The most common causes of car accidents in Australia are speeding, distracted driving, fatigued driving, and drink driving (Car accidents survey & statistics 2021, 2021) all of which exclusively apply to human drivers. However, there are fears that Autonomous Vehicles on Levels 2 and 3 can lull drivers into a false sense of security where they become complacent with their responsibilities and rely too heavily on the vehicle's automation.</p>
            <p>Autonomous vehicles also raise questions around the ethics of discission making. Will cars prioritize the safety of it’s passengers or passers-by in the event of an unavoidable crash. It brings up discussions similar to the classic Trolley problem. </p>
            <p>In 2017 in it was estimated that US Drivers spent an average 97 hours sitting in Traffic with a cost to the economy being over $300 Billion (National Association of City Transportation Offcials, 2019). Freeing up this time for drivers and allowing them to use this for work or leisure adds significant value to an economy and an individual. Combine this added time with a redesign of a car interior, removing unnecessary controls and adding worktops/lounge seating will also enhance this.</p>
            <p>Modern vehicles are relying more heavily on computer managed systems, and this is enhanced with autonomous vehicles. Through collection of the data used by autonomous vehicles there is an ability to give transportation departments enormous data sets to better plan and develop our transit infrastructure (National Association of City Transportation Officials, 2019). The cars can accurately report live traffic flow through GPS location data, can be used for monitoring road conditions and necessary repairs through the onboard sensors and cameras and more. However, collection of data introduces concerns around data privacy and access to information.Through simple methods, such as combining pick-up and drop-off points with public records or reverse address look up data, the journey data can become Personally Identifiable Information and an individual could easily be tracked (National Association of City Transportation Officials, 2019). What data will be collected and who has access to it is an open question.</p>
            <p>This heavy reliance on computers also creates a threat as they could become a target for cyberattacks and other malicious parties.</p>

            <h4>Which people will be most affected and how?</h4>
            <p>The development of Autonomous Vehicles will have the biggest impact upon the transportation industry. Once cars and trucks attain the ability to drive from one location to the next, jobs such as truck drivers and taxi drivers will become obsolete, instead replaced by these self-driving cars.</p>
            <p>In Australia the Transportation Industry accounts for 625,000 workers with 56% of this being made up for road transportation and delivery transportation workers. These occupations have been flagged as having between a 57% and 99% chance of automation (Centre for Future Work at the Australia Institute, 2020). This represents a major change in this industry; however it is estimated that this level of automation will take 15 years giving the economy time to adjust and support the affected workers.</p>
            <p>Historically automation of industry has allowed stronger business investment, which leads to stronger job creation, but there are worries that this time due to the size of the industry being affected and the skill gap between old employment positions and new positions, Truck Driver to Automation Engineer, there will be significant effects to economies and unemployment numbers (Grey, 2014).</p>
            <p>Away from road travel here may also be disruption to the air-travel industry, with people more likely to rely on their cars drive them long-distances while they sleep or do other activities, instead of flying. There are also automation opportunities in Shipping and Rail transportation industries.</p>
            <h4>Integration and Adoption of the technology</h4>
            <p>Whenever new technology is introduced, it is important to think of how people will be able to integrate it into their lives. Should this technology be slowly integrated onto our roads, or should it all be implemented all at once? The possibility of older model cars interferring with autonomous vehicles self-driving is also something that should be considered.</p>
            
            <h3>How will this affect us?</h3>
            <p>When Autonomous Vehicles become adopted widely in society we will start to drive less and rely more on AV’s. There is research that suggests that Human drivers will be illegal by 2050 due to the risk they bring to public roads (Driving will be illegal by 2050, says new study, 2021), so eventually we will not drive at all. </p>
            <p>Depending on the roll out approach (fleets/ride share/private ownership) there may also be a significant drop in Private Car ownership as Automated Taxi services will be able to match the cost per mile of private ownership (Grabar, 2016) . </p>
            <p>Many people could likely have a vested interest in travelling further distances to visit attractions and places more than they currently do. If that thought process is indeed widespread, a boost to domestic travel may be in store as the accessibility, ease, and affordability of travelling via self-driving car may encourage those looking to travel to consider places within driving distance rather than flying either interstate or overseas.</p>
            <p>The potential time saved from not needing to pay attention while commuting could lead to less stress by allowing those workers with longer commutes a time to relax and unwind. Alternatively, this time spent on a commute could be put into something productive such as the learning of new skills.</p>
            <p>As an IT professional the move towards Automation both in vehicles and other industries opens many employment opportunities, both in creating autonomous systems and working with the data collected to improve other areas. </p>
            
            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>The idea of self-driving cars has been dreamed of for decades, for even in the twentieth century people would talk of the future involving self-driving cars, and now it seems this future is right at our doorstep, though how much longer until this becomes our reality remains unknown.</p>

            <h1>Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Small Form Factor Computing</h1>
            <p class="authorship">Written by Gavin Jamieson and Rory Henderson</p>
            <h3>What does it do?</h3>
            <p>While looking similar to a new observer, the Arduino Family and the Raspberry Pi are both very different devices. Arduino is a brand name that has become synonymous with microcontrollers much like Kleenex has become to tissue paper while the device that is most commonly thought of when discussing the Raspberry is in fact a fully featured computer. Both were developed as educational tools but have found uses with hobbyists and researchers and have even been deployed into production environments in a variety of operations.
            </p>
            <p>We will explore the differences and similarities over the next few paragraphs and look at the differences in application for these and similar devices.
            </p>
            <h4>What is the Raspberry Pi?</h4>
            <div class="image_box image_box_float_right">
                <img src="img/pi_model_a_thumb.jpg">
                <p>Raspberry Pi Model B</p>
            </div>
            <p>The Raspberry Pi Family consists of a number of device types. The original Model B was released in 2012 and met with a huge demand. Personally I experienced a 2 month wait to receive mine. Initially the Pi was released with USB, HDMI out, 256MB of RAM, and an SD card slot for loading the OS. This Pi was slightly larger than a credit card in its major dimensions and at its tallest, the height of a PCB mounted RJ45 jack. Over the years this form factor has had a further three iterations with extra features added including Wifi and Blutooth and the family has expanded to include the Raspberry Pi Zero, both much smaller in size. What was revolutionary about the Pi was the incredible performance at the price and the access to the General Purpose Input Output pins. This was something that computer hobbyists in the past had never really had access to in the past without performing modifications to their existing PCs.
            </p>
            <h4>What is the Arduino?</h4>
            <div class="image_box image_box_float_right">
                <img src="img/arduino_uno_thumb.jpg">
                <p>Arduino Uno</p>
            </div>
            <p>It is important to note that Arduino is not actually a specific device or chip, but rather a foundation with a goal to lower the barrier to entry into the world of electronics and microcontrollers. When Arduino is discussed, the most common item that is thought of is the Arduino Uno with the ATmega328 DIP IC. The Uno itself is a single breakout board with an on board ATMega328 Microntroller and the associated electronics required to make it a functional piece of equipment out of the box. Prior to Arduino, when someone wanted to explore the world of electronic engineering and microcontrollers, they had to create a lot of the circuitry themselves and purchase other equipment such as PIC programmers. When referring to an "Arduino", someone may be referring to any number of microcontroller development or breakout boards however they all tend to be programmed using some sort of UART interface using a C like language in the arduino IDE. Since the release of the Arduino Uno, a number of other devices (of note, the ESP32 and ESP12) have been released onto the market with extra features such as wifi and bluetooth.
            </p>
            <h4>What is the difference?</h4>
            <div class="image_box image_box_float_right">
                <img src="img/pi_family_thumb.jpg">
                <p>Different Arduino and Pi models</p>
            </div>
            <p>While the two devices are similar in appearance and can perform some similar applications to each other, the application can vary dramatically. The Raspberry Pi is really just a small computer and as such can support a number of higher level applications, while the arduino is a device that is generally used for an embedded application and rapid prototyping of electronic gadgets. Once you have developed a protoyped it is common to develop your own circuit board around the chip itself, omitting circuitry from the development board that is no longer required and miniaturising the whole assembly for production.
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, generally Arduinos are cheaper, boot faster, are tougher, consume 1/10th of the power, and feature a stronger output current than Raspberry Pi’s. (Library Guides: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Makey Makey kits: Comparing Devices, 2021) 
            </p>
            <p>The Raspberry Pi generally runs a Linux Operating System, while the arduino is generally coded in C and then compiled into Assembly.
            </p>
            <h4>Crossover</h4>
            <p>The Raspberry Pi Foundation released the Raspberry Pi Pico in January 2021.  This is the foundations first release of a microcontroller and is very close to the functionality of an Arduino uno in that it is a microprocessor on a board, as well as a USB driver to program it, power supply to operate it over USB, a crystal on board to drive the clock signal, and all GPIO pins are broken out on the edge of the PCB to allow easy access.</p>
            <h4>What is the future of this technology?</h4>
            <p>As technology improves, further enhancements will be able to be made. In the case of the Arduino style of microcontroller development board, more and more new ICs will be miniaturised and delivered to the market. This will bring newer technologies into the reach of more creators, educators, and hobbyists, which in turn will drive innovation and further new technologies. The future is bright for those that can operate these tools.
            </p>
            <h4>The future of the Raspberry Pi</h4>
            <p>The Raspberry Pi will share a similar trajectory to that of the Arduino, but for a slightly different audience. While the Arduino family comes in a number of different form factors, since the raspberry Pi2, the pi has become locked into its current form factor by its desire to remain backwards compatible with the sheer amount of expansion boards that are available to it. The Raspberry Pi foundation has sought to work around this possible limitation by releasing the Zero and Pico Models, both of which boast similar specifications to their larger brother but with an even smaller form factor.
            </p>
            <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
            <p>With the Pi, an update is normally made every couple of years to improve the specifications of the product and add features as newer technology becomes cheaper and allows the Raspberry Pi Foundation to continue to deliver a low cost product in line with their goals. The future of the Arduino Uno will still remain, however newer chips with better performance and more features in a smaller package continue to be put onto development boards and marketed while the community develops compilers to program them.
            </p>
            <p>The older Raspberry Pis will become obsolete for some use cases as system requirements advance although there will still be a place for them for their orignal purpose of education or even some hobbyist implementations.
            </p>
            <p>The vision of both the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi foundations are very similar, and any improvements that can be made to the technology that allows them to deliver their original visions at a low cost will have a positive impact across the world. Of particular note are groups that may never had access to these sorts of educational materials in the past. As part of the Australian Governments Digital Technologies curriculum, students in year levels as low as 3 and 4 can be taught the basics of flow control and iteration (Australiancurriculum.edu.au. 2022.). The low cost of the Raspberry Pi allows this education to be delivered to areas that in the past could never have hoped to deliver this type of content. Secondly, the low cost allows the technology to be brought into more and more homes where access to anything IT related may have been out of reach in the past.
            </p>
            <p>While developments to these items may not directly make any individual item redundant or relegate it to history, the knowledge, experience, and ideas gained from individuals experimenting and developing these sorts of platforms will continue to drive innovation an the IT and electronic engineering sectors.
            </p>
            <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
            <h4>How will it affect me personally?</h4>
            <p>I am always finding a use for this sort of technology in various hobbies and further improvements and miniaturisation is only every a good thing in my opinion. More access to this sort of technology will enable innovation from a wider cross section of the community. A person who may have only had a passing interest in electronics or engineering may be driven to explore the topic further and accomplish great things because the basic tools were accessible to them easily.
            </p>
            <h4>How will it affect the wider community
            </h4>
            <h5>Changes to how we use IT</h5>
            <p>While a computer may have been a ubiquitous item in the household recently, more and more the internet is being accessed by mobile devices instead of computers(Australian Bureau of Statistics. 2022). Think of your own friends and colleagues with children in Primary school that do not have a laptop or desktop computer in the house and instead accomplish the entirety of their online lives using mobile devices. Those same people may have no interest in setting aside their limited space for a desktop computer or an IT workspace and the leading mobile devices do not have much of a facility for any sort of software or technology development.</p>
            <h5>Where does this leave the children?</h5>
            <p>Consider a child growing up in a household like the one detailed above. It would be such a shame to see the interest in technology or creativity stifled due to a large cost barrier to enter or the amount of space that a dektop computer or an electronics workspace could take up in a small envirnoment. This problem is overcome by the small nature of devices like the Raspberry Pi and Arduino family. Being able to cultivate interst in these fields from a young age at home and at their own pace may be enough to change the trajectory of their life and career forever.

            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>While researching this, I came across the blog page https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ on the Raspberry Pi Foundation website. A number of the stories listed echo my own thoughts and the facts detailed above. I would encourage anyone reading this to have a quick browse and see how the foundation is indeed making a difference.

            <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
            <p class="authorship">Written by Andrew Suhr, Kyle Ross, Gavin Jamieson</p>
            <h3>What Does it do</h3>
            <p>Early on in the history of the internet and smaller networks, the architecture was quite simple. A server is basically a single computer sitting in a rack and taking requests for a single application, whether that is a website, email, or a gaming server. This worked for small scale operations but as the application for internet services grew and grew it was found to be insufficient. Cloud computing treats servers as a service that one company can provide to another. You may not have your application served from the same physical hardware from day to day and you may not even run the same number of servers. The cloud could be considered to be renting servers on demand and providing a vast amount of flexibility to meet demand.</p>
            <p>Consider the case of a company that sells a product available in its online store. In the traditional Client-Server arrangement you would own or rent a number of physical servers either on your own premises or in a data center. The amount of servers available would be enough to match your average demand with some flex room available for some peaks. Should demand spike, say in the event of an online sale, then the response time for the online store could increase which could potentially result in lost business. Using cloud computing, you can automatically scale the operation up and down depending on the demand for services.</p>
             <div class="image_box image_box_float_right">
                <img src="img/cloud_thumb.jpg">
            </div>
	    <h4>What makes this possible?</h4>
            <p>The largest advancement in technology that grew cloud computing was the concept of the Virtual Machine. This allowed for a single phyiscal server to run a number of virtual servers transparently to the end user. Another big advancement was the creation of technology like Docker. Docker allowed for the creation of not just virtual machines, but virtual networks connecting those machines. These virtual machines can be scripted to start and stop automatically based on almost any criteria, from a failure on one machine, to a spike in demand across the network, to a network failure in an entire area.</p>
            <h4>Is there still a place for on-premisis servers?</h4>
            <p>This is like asking "how long is a piece of string?". What works for one organisation may not be appropriate for another. Some organisations may be particularly security conscious and prefer to have complete control over the hardware, data, and networks. Others may be running some older legacy services that does not lend itself to more complex network.</p>
            <p>There is still a cost vs benefit split in on-prem vs cloud computing. The scale of the operation may not warrant big dollars spent on cloud services and may be able to support the servers in house.(Burkhalter, 2021)</p>
            <h3>The future of cloud computing</h3>
            <h4>New Markets</h4>
            <p>Cloud providers and data centres are expected to expand around the world continuously over the next few years. A market in Africa is beginning to emerge as mobile networks increase in speed and penetration across the continent and the internet becomes more accessible. As this market expands, large and small cloud providers will start to build more datacentres to adaquetly service the growing number of online businesses and consumers. We could potentially see a revolution in the way the entire African continent conducts commerce.</p>
            <h4>A larger move to cloud?</h4>
            <p>BYOD is expanding as companies aim to limit expenditure. There are a couple of problems that face most BYOD companies, one is "How do I secure my data", another is "How do I control costs when trying to support a non standard environment". An answer to this could be a product like Azure Virtual Desktop(azure.microsoft.com, n.d.). This allows the same controlled desktop environment to be accessed on any device by a user. This allows data to be kept more secure than on the users personal device and shifts the responsibility for the maintenance of the computer on to the user</p>

      <H3>What is the likely impact?</H3>
            <p>There are many positive impacts in the advancement and usage of cloud computing. With it giving the ability to connect to a network from across the globe, employeers are able to work from wherever in the world they may be instead of being constricted to a certain country or state. Cloud storage is the most popular form of cloud services (and that which most think of when discussing cloud technology), with it you are able to safely store and backup any data you wish to safekeep at will via uploading to a companies cloud, from there you can continuously update documents via uploading of your local files, and then redownload these files when need be. Loss of important documents, media, and memories has plagued those with important documents since computing became a part of every day life, and with computing services, complete loss of data is a harder feat to achieve.</p>
            <H4>Potential Problems</H4>
            <p>With the progression and introduction of new technology, there are often risks. A potential risk that is taken with cloud computing is the fact your data becomes more a target due to being store en masse. Though wrong-doers may not be intentionally targeting your data, breaches within the network your data is stored on leaves your data vulnerable. Though data breaches are few and far between, storing data and using cloud computing is still a safer option than to that of storing your data all in one area locally.</p>
            <H4>Impact on business</H4>
            <p>Businesses using cloud computing and storage benefit from the flexibility and scalability of the service. Not only are they spending less on hardware, maintenance and upgrade costs are dramatically reduced. Using cloud services allows for easy expansion and the ease of upgradeability to future technologies.</p>
            <H4> </H4>

	    <H3>How will this affect me?</H3>
            <p>So much of our day-to-day life is already reliant on cloud computing creating a huge social impact on society. Most people don’t recognise they’re using cloud services constantly from streaming videos on Netflix, music on Spotify, gaming online, using google services, email, or perhaps most prominent these days using social media like Facebook, Instagram, and twitter. Cloud computing services is also the number one place for information and news headlines.</p>
            <H4>Personal storage</H4>
            <p>Cloud computing is making the use of portable hard drives a thing of the past as anyone with an email can easily access online cloud storage services like drobox, google drive, One drive free of charge.</p>
            <H4>Online shopping</H4>
            <p>Businesses are storing online shopping customers data on the cloud to better cater to their needs, make future purchase recommendations according data analysis of previous purchases and improve overall customer service.</p>
            <H4>Education</H4>
            <p>The education sector has largely adopted cloud computing (even more so during the pandemic) as it gives students, teachers, and other staff the ability to access shared data and interact with each other outside of the classroom like never before. Cloud services allow schools to store data securely without the need of installing expensive infrastructure, it has made education more accessible worldwide.</p>
            <H4>Health</H4>
            <p>Healthcare is another area where cloud computing is becoming increasingly important. As you’d imagine keeping a paper record of patients would not only take up a lot of space but many man hours of managing and maintaining records, using cloud services reduces operational costs, is far more convenient and makes it so patients have easier access to their own records.</p>
            <H4>Navigation</H4>
            <p>The cloud has made travel easier than ever before. Most phones and devices now have map applications that can function anywhere in the world as long an internet connect is established or destinations are pre-downloaded, some services even offer live updates on routes and traffic.</p>
            <H3>Final thoughts</H3>
            <p>Cloud computing is quicky becoming an essential part of everyday life. We’ve relied on cloud services for many years already and that will only continue to grow in future as it reduces costs, has positive effects on the environment and improves communication and resources.</p>

            <h1>Cyber Security</h1>
            <p class="authorship">Written by Andrew Suhr and Evan Phelps</p>
            <h3>What does it do?</h3>
            <p>Cybersecurity (also known as Information security) refers to the practice of defending internet-connected computers, devices, electronic systems, data, hardware and servers against malicious cyber-attacks and unauthorised access. A cyber criminal’s objective usually includes accessing, tampering with or destroying sensitive information, stealing or extorting funds, interrupting business and community services that can result in disruptions and major financial lose.
            </p>
             <div class="image_box image_box_float_right">
                <img src="img/cybersecurity_thumb.jpg">
            </div>
            <p>In today’s world cybersecurity is essential because governments, military, businesses, health providers and financial institutes collect, share and store large quantities of data on cloud services, computers, and other hardware. A lot of this data can be sensitive information such as financial records, personal information, health records, classified documentation, information relating to national security, Intellectual property, or other forms of data where any modification or unauthorized access could have a very negative result, possibly jeopardising finances or the health and safety of one or many people. Cybersecurity helps protect these types of data from attack as they’re transmitted via the internet from one party to another as well safeguarding systems used to store and process this data.
            </p>
            <p>Cybersecurity has an ever-evolving set of tools, technologies and risk management strategies designed to protect networks, devices and data from cyber-attacks and data breaches.
            The different elements of cybersecurity used currently include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Network Security - Monitors incoming and outgoing data traffic on the network to avoid an attack and it’s spread.</li>
            <li>    Data Loss Prevention - Protects data by focusing on its location and monitoring when the data is active and inactive.</li>
            <li>    Cloud Security - Security focused specifically on cloud services and apps.</li>
            <li>    Intrusion Detection Systems - These systems focus is to flag possible hostile cyber-attack threats.</li>
            <li>    Identity and Access Management - Limits access to employees and tracks internal systems for harmful software.</li>
            <li>    Encryption - Encoding data rendering it inaccessible to avoid theft when transmitting over the internet.</li>
            <li>    Application security - Developing and testing security features within applications to prevent security breaches against unauthorized access and modification.</li>
             <li>   Information or data security - Systems preventing unauthorized access, disruption, modification or destruction of information or data.</li>
             <li>   Disaster recovery/business continuity planning - Restoring data and IT infrastructure after a disaster, Business continuity is keeping the operations ongoing during a disaster.</li>
             <li>   Operational security (OPSEC) - Risk management system that prevents sensitive data leaks.</li>
             <li>   Critical infrastructure security - The protection of operating networks and assets deemed essential to ensure the security of a nation, its economy and its public safety.</li>
             <li>   Physical security - A security force protecting physical forms of data, software, hardware, networks.</li>
             <li>   End-user education - Factors in human error, aims to avoid accidental security breaches and viruses.</li>
             <li>   Antivirus/anti-malware – Scans a computers system for potential viruses and threats.</li>
             </ul>

             <p>Changes to authentication, logins and passwords is something we’re likely to see in cybersecurity over the next few years. Similar to the transition of facial recognition on our personal devices, additional biometric precautions like retinal scanning, fingerprints, voice sampling could be further implemented to safeguard sensitive data and prevent unauthorised access. We’re likely to see a further dependence on AI regarding cybersecurity in the coming years.
             </p>

            <p>The increase reliance on cloud computing and its expansion ensures the same of cybersecurity and its development. Developing new ways to store and transfer data creates new obstacles and challenges for the cybersecurity field to overcome, as there are more ways to gain access to data there too must be ways to prevent it.
            Also, as more and more internet devices are implemented into our professional and personal lives it creates more vulnerability for data breaches so this too will see more of an emphasis on cybersecurity into the future as everyone’s personal data could be at risk.</p>

            <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
            <p>According to research from the UK's Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, 65% of medium-sized businesses reported that they'd faced a security breach or cyber attack in 2021, and consistently this number has been around the 66% mark for several years. Around 50% have reported that they needed new prevention methods, and additional staff, to deal with these breaches. However, COVID appears to be affecting businesses' ability to administer proper security in a severe way; with less overall security monitoring and user monitoring, the increasing move to the digital world for many people is putting much greater strain on companies, professional bodies, government agencies, and more. While the field of cybersecurity aims to protect and secure the important data of people and companies, in many places it is simply being outpaced by the rapid shifts of potential attackers.</p>
            <p>Right now, this continual threat has influenced Australian industries to start considering it standard practice to implement external, independent, annual cyber-security health checks across all businesses. Many see this annual review as a good opportunity to ensure that the escalating risks have been properly taken into consideration, and that their organisation has not faltered in any material capacity when it comes to keeping up with their security - with the rate of change from the attackers' sides, any organisation with little or no material changes has almost certainly been exponentially outpaced and faces much, much greater risks.</p>
            <p>When it comes to more individual security measures however, one must seriously begin to consider the implications of many proposed, and active, security protocols. As society moves more and more of itself fully online, and as companies continue to discover more and more ways to monetise the very data itself of users, we may very likely find that technology becomes ever-more intrusive into our privacy. Every potential piece of data, scanned and recorded into some myriad of obfuscated databases, giving big tech corporations even more ways to track you and those close to you. Invasive security laws already permit Australian law enforcement agencies to use and collect any data they want without adhering to standard privacy guidlines, so long as said agency can "satisfy itself on reasonable grounds that non-compliance with one or more of the listed privacy principles is necessary in order to achieve or carry out the enforcement function in question." (QLD OIC guidelines, 2017)</p>

            <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
            <p>Following on from the prior section, cybersecurity is a blanket field that has an enormous potential effect on individuals - particularly their data, their rights, and their online freedom. Sure, one may not be a business or run a company, or even have to think about organisational security in any real capacity, but governments around the world will certainly be thinking about it. The biggest individual effects would come from a government, like that of Australia's, implementing far-reaching data laws that allow even greater access and control over things like your internet history, your text messages, or your constant location data (bearing in mind, even "anonymised" location data isn't truly anonymous, as noted by PhilosophyTube - <a href="https://youtu.be/fCUTX1jurJ4">this video</a> is an excellent illustrative breakdown of many of the ideas here.)</p>

            <div class="image_box image_box_float_right">
                <iframe width="576" height="324" src="https://youtube.com/embed/fCUTX1jurJ4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>On a much less federal level, one's individual data privacy is still an important concern even without the complex security systems afforded to larger corporations. However, many data breaches and "cyber attacks" don't take place in shady rooms with hooded figures mashing away at keyboards, despite the image CSI would like to present. "Phishing" is a term used to describe a much more grounded form of digital scam, where instead of attempting to covertly break into someone's account, a scammer simply pretends and presents themselves as some kind of IT professional, or website staff, or similar, and merely <i>asks</i> a user for their account information. If the user is duped by the scam, the "hacker" gains access to all their personal info and anything else the account gives them free reign over, without so much as a single technical hack. While it is possible to get attacked as an individual through more convoluted process, it is far more likely that you will be subjected to phishing or other social engineering scams instead. For this reason, the effect of cybersecurity to the layman should be to simply be aware while doing anything online of what might be a scam, and reduce their own risk through good password habits (like not sharing them between multiple sites).</p>
