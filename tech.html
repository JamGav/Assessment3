            <h3>What does it do?</h3>
            <p>While looking similar to a new observer, the Arduino Family and the Raspberry Pi are both very different devies. Arduino is a brand name that has become synonymous with microcontrollers much like Kleenex has become to tissue paper while the device that is most commonly thought of when discussing the Raspberry is in fact a fully featured computer. Both were developed as educational tools but have found uses with hobbyists and researchers and have even been deployed into production environments in a variety of operations.
            </p>
            <p>We will explore the differences and similarities over the next few paragraphs and look at the differences in application for these and similar devices.
            </p>
            <h4>What is the Raspberry Pi?</h4>
            <div class="image_box image_box_float_right">
                <img src="img/pi_model_a_thumb.jpg">
                <p>Raspberry Pi Model B</p>
            </div>
            <p>The Raspberry Pi Family consists of a number of device types. The original Model B was released in 2012 and met with a huge demand. Personally I experienced a 2 month wait to receive mine. Initially the Pi was released with USB, HDMI out, 256MB of RAM, and an SD card slot for loading the OS. This Pi was slightly larger than a credit card in its major dimensions and at its tallest, the height of a PCB mounted RJ45 jack. Over the years this form factor has had a further three iterations with extra features added including Wifi and Blutooth and the family has expanded to include the Raspberry Pi Zero and the Raspberry Pi Pico, both much smaller in size. What was revolutionary about the Pi was the incredible performance at the price and the access to the General Purpose Input Output pins. This was something that computer hobbyists in the past had never really had access to in the past without performing modifications to their existing PCs.
            </p>
            <h4>What is the Arduino?</h4>
            <div class="image_box image_box_float_right">
                <img src="img/arduino_uno_thumb.jpg">
                <p>Arduino Uno</p>
            </div>
            <p>It is important to note that Arduino is not actually a specific device or chip, but rather a foundation with a goal to lower the barrier to entry into the world of electronics and microcontrollers. When Arduino is discussed, the most common item that is thought of is the Arduino Uno with the ATmega328 DIP IC. The Uno itself is a single breakout board with an on board ATMega328 Microntroller and the associated electronics required to make it a functional piece of equipment out of the box. Prior to Arduino, when someone wanted to explore the world of electronic engineering and microcontrollers, they had to create a lot of the circuitry themselves and purchase other equipment such as PIC programmers. When referring to an "Arduino", someone may be referring to any number of microcontroller development or breakout boards however they all tend to be programmed using some sort of UART interface using a C like language in the arduino IDE. Since the release of the Arduino Uno, a number of other devices (of note, the ESP32 and ESP12) have been released onto the market with extra features such as wifi and bluetooth.
            </p>
            <h4>What is the difference?</h4>
            <div class="image_box image_box_float_right">
                <img src="img/pi_family_thumb.jpg">
                <p>Different Arduino and Pi models</p>
            </div>
            <p>While the two devices are similar in appearance and can perform some similar applications to each other, the application can vary dramatically. The Raspberry Pi is really just a small computer and as such can support a number of higher level applications, while the arduino is a device that is generally used for an embedded application and rapid prototyping of electronic gadgets. Once you have developed a protoyped it is common to develop your own circuit board around the chip itself, omitting circuitry from the development board that is no longer required and miniaturising the whole assembly for production.
            </p>
            <p>The Raspberry Pi generally runs a Linux Operating System, while the arduino is generally coded in C and then compiled into Assembly.
            </p>
            <h4>What is the future of this technology?</h4>
            <p>As technology improves, further enhancements will be able to be made. In the case of the Arduino style of microcontroller development board, more and more new ICs will be miniaturised and delivered to the market. This will bring newer technologies into the reach of more creators, educators, and hobbyists, which in turn will drive innovation and further new technologies. The future is bright for those that can operate these tools.
            </p>
            <h4>The future of the Raspberry Pi</h4>
            <p>I predict will share a similar trajectory to that of the Arduino, but for a slightly different audience. While the Arduino family comes in a number of different form factors, since the raspberry Pi2, the pi has become locked into its current form factor by its desire to remain backwards compatible with the sheer amount of expansion boards that are available to it. The Raspberry Pi foundation has sought to work around this possible limitation by releasing the Zero and Pico Models, both of which boast similar specifications to their larger brother but with an even smaller form factor.
            </p>
            <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
            <p>With the Pi, an update is normally made every couple of years to improve the specifications of the product and add features as newer technology becomes cheaper and allows the Raspberry Pi Foundation to continue to deliver a low cost product in line with their goals. The future of the Arduino Uno will still remain, however newer chips with better performance and more features in a smaller package continue to be put onto development boards and marketed while the community develops compilers to program them.
            </p>
            <p>The older Raspberry Pis will become obsolete for some use cases as system requirements advance although there will still be a place for them for their orignal purpose of education or even some hobbyist implementations.
            </p>
            <p>The vision of both the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi foundations are very similar, and any improvements that can be made to the technology that allows them to deliver their original visions at a low cost will have a positive impact across the world. Of particular note are groups that may never had access to these sorts of educational materials in the past. As part of the Australian Governments Digital Technologies curriculum, students in year levels as low as 3 and 4 can be taught the basics of flow control and iteration (Ref Page 2: https://docs.acara.edu.au/resources/Digital_Technologies_-_Sequence_of_content.pdf). The low cost of the Raspberry Pi allows this education to be delivered to areas that in the past could never have hoped to deliver this type of content. Secondly, the low cost allows the technology to be brought into more and more homes where access to anything IT related may have been out of reach in the past.
            </p>
            <p>While developments to these items may not directly make any individual item redundant or relegate it to history, the knowledge, experience, and ideas gained from individuals experimenting and developing these sorts of platforms will continue to drive innovation an the IT and electronic engineering sectors.
            </p>
            <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
            <h4>How will it affect me personally?</h4>
            <p>I am always finding a use for this sort of technology in various hobbies and further improvements and miniaturisation is only every a good thing in my opinion. More access to this sort of technology will enable innovation from a wider cross section of the community. A person who may have only had a passing interest in electronics or engineering may be driven to explore the topic further and accomplish great things because the basic tools were accessible to them easily.
            </p>
            <h4>How will it affect the wider community
            </h4>
            <h5>Changes to how we use IT</h5>
            <p>While a computer may have been a ubiquitous item in the household recently, more and more the internet is being accessed by mobile devices instead of computers (Ref: https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/industry/technology-and-innovation/household-use-information-technology/latest-release). Personally I have friends and colleagues with children in Primary school that do not have a laptop or desktop computer in the house and instead accomplish the entirety of their online lives using mobile devices. These same people have no interest in setting aside their limited space for a desktop computer or an IT workspace and the leading mobile devices do not have much of a facility for any sort of software or technology development.</p>
            <h5>Where does this leave the children?</h5>
            <p>Consider a child growing up in a household like the one detailed above. It would be such a shame to see the interest in technology or creativity stifled due to a large cost barrier to enter or the amount of space that a dektop computer or an electronics workspace could take up in a small envirnoment. This problem is overcome by the small nature of devices like the Raspberry Pi and Arduino family. Being able to cultivate interst in these fields from a young age at home and at their own pace may be enough to change the trajectory of their life and career forever.
            </p>
            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>While researching this, I came across the blog page https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ on the Raspberry Pi Foundation website. A number of the stories listed echo my own thoughts and the facts detailed above. I would encourage anyone reading this to have a quick browse and see how the foundation is indeed making a difference.

            <h3>What does it do?</h3>
            <p>Cybersecurity (also known as Information security) refers to the practice of defending internet-connected computers, devices, electronic systems, data, hardware and servers against malicious cyber-attacks and unauthorised access. A cyber criminal’s objective usually includes accessing, tampering with or destroying sensitive information, stealing or extorting funds, interrupting business and community services that can result in disruptions and major financial lose.
            </p>

                <img src="img/cybersecurity_thumb.jpg">
            </div>
            <p>In today’s world cybersecurity is essential because governments, military, businesses, health providers and financial institutes collect, share and store large quantities of data on cloud services, computers, and other hardware. A lot of this data can be sensitive information such as financial records, personal information, health records, classified documentation, information relating to national security, Intellectual property, or other forms of data where any modification or unauthorized access could have a very negative result, possibly jeopardising finances or the health and safety of one or many people. Cybersecurity helps protect these types of data from attack as they’re transmitted via the internet from one party to another as well safeguarding systems used to store and process this data.
            </p>
            <p>Cybersecurity has an ever-evolving set of tools, technologies and risk management strategies designed to protect networks, devices and data from cyber-attacks and data breaches.
            The different elements of cybersecurity used currently include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Network Security - Monitors incoming and outgoing data traffic on the network to avoid an attack and it’s spread.</li>
            <li>    Data Loss Prevention - Protects data by focusing on its location and monitoring when the data is active and inactive.</li>
            <li>    Cloud Security - Security focused specifically on cloud services and apps.</li>
            <li>    Intrusion Detection Systems - These systems focus is to flag possible hostile cyber-attack threats.</li>
            <li>    Identity and Access Management - Limits access to employees and tracks internal systems for harmful software.</li>
            <li>    Encryption - Encoding data rendering it inaccessible to avoid theft when transmitting over the internet.</li>
            <li>    Application security - Developing and testing security features within applications to prevent security breaches against unauthorized access and modification.</li>
             <li>   Information or data security - Systems preventing unauthorized access, disruption, modification or destruction of information or data.</li>
             <li>   Disaster recovery/business continuity planning - Restoring data and IT infrastructure after a disaster, Business continuity is keeping the operations ongoing during a disaster.</li>
             <li>   Operational security (OPSEC) - Risk management system that prevents sensitive data leaks.</li>
             <li>   Critical infrastructure security - The protection of operating networks and assets deemed essential to ensure the security of a nation, its economy and its public safety.</li>
             <li>   Physical security - A security force protecting physical forms of data, software, hardware, networks.</li>
             <li>   End-user education - Factors in human error, aims to avoid accidental security breaches and viruses.</li>
             <li>   Antivirus/anti-malware – Scans a computers system for potential viruses and threats.</li>
             </ul>
             
             <p>Changes to authentication, logins and passwords is something we’re likely to see in cybersecurity over the next few years. Similar to the transition of Facial recognition on our personal devices, additional biometric precautions like retinal scanning, fingerprints, voice sampling could be further implemented to safeguard sensitive data and prevent unauthorised access.We’re likely to see a further dependence on AI regarding cybersecurity in the coming years.
             </p>

            <p>The increase reliance on cloud computing and its expansion ensures the same of cybersecurity and its development. Developing new ways to store and transfer data creates new obstacles and challenges for the cybersecurity field to overcome, as there are more ways to gain access to data there too must be ways to prevent it.
            Also, as more and more internet devices are implemented into our professional and personal lives it creates more vulnerability for data breaches so this too will see more of an emphasis on cybersecurity into the future as everyone’s personal data could be at risk.</p>
