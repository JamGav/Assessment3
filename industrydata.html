            <H3>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</H3>
            <p>Kyle (Game Developer): After having researched and read the Burning Glass data, I've found my ideal job and my opinion of it to be unchanged. I was already aware of the collaborative aspect required to succeed in the position, however I have learnt of new areas and technologies I can continue to work on to properly prepare myself for a situation in which I attain my ideal job.</p>
            <p>Gavin (Backend Developer): The Burning Glass data aligned with my expectations of what is required for this role.  As such, I havent had any major change of heart.  While a passion of mine still remains with electronics and embedded devices, I am happy for that to remain a hobby.</p>
            <p>-Collaborate and discuss!</p>
            <h3>Collective jobs data</h3>
            <p>Using the burning glass data to identify the top in demand General and IT skills that were shared by at least two members we found that across those different jobs the top skill requirements for each role were varied, although each required some sort of scripting or programming skills. As such, any programming language(i.e. Java, python, Javascript) was rolled up into the general term "Programming". The top general skills from the burning glass data showed that the in demand skills were common across all jobs.</p>
