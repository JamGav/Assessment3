            <p>Comparing our Ideal Jobs revealed some similarities and overlap between Job Titles and descriptions.</p>

            <p>Andrew and Kyle both had their ideal Job as a  Games developer. Their desire to work in Game Development would require a thorough knowledge of a coding language such as C# or C++, the knowledge and understanding of a game engine (Unity, Unreal Engine etc.) and have experience in general software development as their work is heavily code related. Software developers are by far the most sought after with the highest listings of jobs according to the burning glass data (29,456 out of 121,997 listings). The next most relevant job title to Games development would be Computer programmer with far less listings (4,436) but still ranks in the top 10 occupations. </p>

            <p>Evan and Gavin both had roles that fit under a Backend developer description. Their desire to work in Back end development would require...??? Computer programmer would be the top relevant job to Backend developer in the Burning Glass data. Database is a skill required in the Backend development job listings; Database administrator has 3,622 listings falling just out of the top 10 occupations at number 11.</p>

            <p>Rory's ideal job was as an Azure incident manager. His desire to work as an Azure Incident Manager would require...??? No Job titles line up perfectly to fit this role, but there are multiple occupations in the Burning Glass data that are loosely related including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Software Engineer #1 (29,456 listings), which Andrew and Kyle also matched with</li>
                <li>Computer Systems Engineer/ Architect #2 (13,111 listings)</li>
                <li>Network/ Systems Administrator #4 (9,830 listings)</li>
                <li>IT manager #10 (3,749 listings)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall it was good to see that our Ideal Jobs have a decent demand and are all ranked within the top 50% of the Burning Glass Data.</p>

            <H3>Skills</H3>
            <p>Using the burning glass data to identify the top in demand General and IT skills that were shared by at least two members we found that across those different jobs the top skill requirements for each role were varied, although each required some sort of scripting or programming skills. As such, any programming language(i.e. Java, python, Javascript) was rolled up into the general term "Programming". The top general skills from the burning glass data showed that the in demand skills were common across all jobs.</p>

            <p>There are many overlaps when it comes to skill requirements for each group member's ideal job, with some group members even having chosen the same field.</p>
            <p>Some IT related requirements of each ideal job:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Programming in various languages relevant to each industry (e.g., C++, C#, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS).</li>
                <li>A relevant degree in Computer Science / Information Technology and/or multiple years of relevant experience in the job’s requirements.</li>
                <li>Knowledge and proficiency in cloud services.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some fundamental skills unspecific to the IT industry are required for all group members' jobs, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Communication and collaboration with fellow staff.</li>
                <li>Ability to work as part of a team. </li>
                <li>Problem solving through adaptive decision making.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We break this down further and map it to the Breaking Glass Data below.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>Out of the 10 IT specific skills we identified as a group we match the top 4 desired by employers, which is good to see. However, the other skills that we identified are all out of the top 10, with some falling towards the bottom of the employees desired list. </p>

            <H3>General skills by demand from employers?</H3>
            <ul>
                <li>Communication skills - #1 (44,367 out of 121,997 postings)</li>
                <li>Problem solving - #2 (16,445 out of 121,997 postings)

                <li>Quality assurance and control #14 (4,444 out of 121,997 postings)
            </ul>
            <p>Out of the 10 General Skills we identified as a group we match the top 8 desired by employees, which is very encouraging. Our two skills that fall out of the top 10 are still in high demand.</p>

            <H3>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</H3>
           <p>Although we identified the top 4 skills being relevant to ideal jobs, we did not select any of the skills in the rest of the top ten. The three highest ranked IT skills not in our IT Specific skill set are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Project management - #5 (2,252 out of 27,435 postings)</li>
                <li>SAP - #6 (2,189 out of 27,435 postings)</li>
                <li>Business management - #7 (2,141 out of 27,435 postings)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This reflects our overall combination with some skills, such as Project management being relevant to Rory in his ideal role and SAP which would affect all roles in a user capacity not being included in out top 10 selected skills. </p>
            
            <H3>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</H3>
            <p>We identified the top 8 General Skills as relevant to our ideal jobs. The three highest ranked General skills not in our IT Specific skill set are: </p>
            <li>Creativity #9 (7,475 out of 121,997 postings)</li>
            <li>Research #10 (7,227 out of 121,997 postings)</li>
            <li>Leadership #11 (5,144 out of 121,997 postings)</li>

            <H3>Modern Data</H3>
            <p>Whilst researching the current IT job market we were unable to find a comparable modern data set, however, we did find multiple articles that highlighted a growing demand for IT skills by employers, with digital skills making up 70% of all fast-growing skills (Strack et al., 2019).</p>
            <p>New technology skills in fields such as AI, the IoT, Cloud Solutions and Machine learning have all seen a growth of upwards of 49% in mentions from 2015-2018 (Strack et al., 2019). </p>
            <p>Comparing our Ideal Jobs to the Six most in-demand tech sectors and jobs as identified by HAYS is also reassuring as Cloud Solutions which links to Rory’s ideal Job and our collective requirement of Cloud Services is second and Software Development which links directly to Drew and Kyles ideal job being 5th (Six of the most in-demand tech sectors and jobs, 2020).</p>

            <H3>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</H3>
            <p>Andrew (Game developer): The Burning Glass data has shown me that perhaps I should have a broader scope of IT fields when looking for a job in IT so that starting a new career is more attainable. Instead of just focusing on Game development I should also consider other programming and software development roles.</p>
            <p>Evan</p>
            <p>Gavin (Backend Developer): The Burning Glass data aligned with my expectations of what is required for this role.  As such, I havent had any major change of heart.  While a passion of mine still remains with electronics and embedded devices, I am happy for that to remain a hobby.</p>
            <p>Rory</p>
            <p>Kyle (Game Developer): After having researched and read the Burning Glass data, I've found my ideal job and my opinion of it to be unchanged. I was already aware of the collaborative aspect required to succeed in the position, however I have learnt of new areas and technologies I can continue to work on to properly prepare myself for a situation in which I attain my ideal job.</p>
