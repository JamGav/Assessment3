                <li>Discussion of how we want to approach the video</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Actions</h3>
            <P>Thanks All for your time today. Please see the actions below. </P>
            <p>General: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contribute to the Group Task for week 7, 7.2.1. Gavin has started us off, please contribute before Saturday when Gavin will collate our thoughts and post our response.</li>
                <li>Sign and submit the A2 Contribution form </li>
                <li>Taks 4 is an individual Task but requires the course work to be completed and is due at the same time as A3 and A5. Please try and keep on top of the weekly course work, to avoid having to catch up towards the end of the course and taking away from Team time. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>A3: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>We will have a weekly scheduled meeting after the Tut every Wednesday.</li>
                <li>Gavin Fork the repo, invite all team members, create the group website </li>
                <li>Start to go through and customize the existing site for A3. Copy headings and structure your content under the headings from the Assessment Sheet. This makes it easier to mark and easier for us to track progress. Let's aim to have the site with all headings up before our next meeting. </li>
                <li>Start reading and drafting parts to add to the Project. Rory will aim to have a Draft of the “Project Overview”, “Ethical Risks” and “Group Processes and Communications” up before our next meeting. Other sections like Tools and technologies and Team Profile can be taken and adapted from A2. All sections will develop as we develop the app. If you have sections you want to focus on during this week, please comment them below.</li>
                <li>Rory will add a Draft for our scope. Please read and add your changes pre the next meeting. This will be our goals for the next 5 weeks, so make sure you agree and are onboard. </li>
                <li>We need to plan/track our progress weekly for the Timeframe requirement of the assessment. For this week everyone's task is to research App development, to help us plan our development.</li>
                <li>We are aiming to have the task completed on Sunday the 13th, to give us time to edit, format the report and finalize all content.</li>
                <li>Rory to upload his summary document on A3 to Teams.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A5: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>think about how we want to present information. Draft Script and Storyboards are due in Week 10. A lot of this will be taken from A3, so get writing and committing.</li>
                <li>Drew and Evan to create some custom Stingers and a brand audio logo.</li>
            </ul>
