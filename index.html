            <h2>Meetings</h2>
            <p>We have had multiple meetings over the course of working on Assessment 2.

            <h3>Agenda</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Share your 2-3 Team names. We need to lock in on one of these during this session.</li>
                <li>Decide if we want a webpage or regular project page for the GitHub Repo? (Ask Evan)</li>
                <li>Discuss the Burning Glass Data. Did anyone find anything better?</li>
                <li>Schedule the interview with the IT Professional.</li>
                <li>Discuss the “Pursuit of Hoppiness”. How can it be developed? Do you have any insight on technologies that can be used? Do you have any concerns? I haven’t received any feedback on the assessment yet.</li>
                <li>Discuss how we want to approach writing and deadlines for when we need drafts/finals of each part.</li>
                <li>If we get time share your research of your IT Technology. There is a breakout feature (I think) in teams, that will facilitate the individual teams to break out. This is what we are looking at:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Andrew Suhr –Cyber, cloud services</li>

                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>We should look at assigning one member of each team to being the write up on the technology (we can break down the three areas, Summary of the tech, impact on the future, personal impact, to share this role).</p>
