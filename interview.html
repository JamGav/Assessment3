            <h2>Summary: </h2>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Alan works as a software developer for one of the big 5 banks in Canada. He has been a developer in this role for 2 years. The software he develops is for internal use and does not do any front facing work. His work focus’s around API development, which he described as a program running on a server which is designed to have requests for content sent to it and then a response sent out. <br>
                Alan looks at the problems presented by his team, forms a methodology for how to resolve this and then interprets that into code. Once written Alan does his own testing before sharing it with users and supporting its deployment. He occasionally contributes design suggestions based on his own experience working with the software. <br>
                The whole banking industry in Canada work in Java. This supports the homogenous environment required for work. The industry is built on existing systems and mainframes that were in place far before Alan started his career. He flagged this as a potential issue mentioning Y2K. </p>

            <h3>Structure </h3>
            <p>Business System Analyst (BSA) identifies the software development needs within the company, which they pass onto solution designers.<br>
                Solutions Designers are the lead developers of a development team. They organizes the developers within their team, distribute work and answer questions about the integrations being developed. They are usually the main interfaces with the BSA/stakeholders, but other in the development team can sometimes talk directly to these other parties.<br>
                Developers develop the solution. These solutions are developed individually with testing being completed before being passed on to the Testers.<br>
                Testers test the solutions created by the developers. They reach back to highlight any issues found/ask questions about the development. Testers test the code in wider situations than the developer to ensure that it is compatible and will work in all situations.<br>
                In addition to this Structure Alan will also interacts with other development teams to ask questions about their API’s if it is relevant to his development.<br>
                Alan encourages light social interaction between team members, as it supports a stronger team. </p>

            <h3>Time Spent</h3>
            <p>In his role Alan spends most of his time analyzing requirements. He does not approach beginning the implementation until he has a complete and total understanding of the requirements and a plan for how to approach the problem.<br>
                He mentioned that some developers work differently approaching the issue without a clear plan in mind and instead learning and working towards a solution during the development process. </p>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>Alan flagged that the biggest issue he faces is interacting with QA and dealing with their mistakes. QA will often not consider what the issue is before bringing it to Alan to resolve.<br>
                All API requests are in Json format and usually, the issue is with the Json request that was being sent to the API. These issues are often as simple as miss spelling or a missed bracket and only take ten seconds to resolve but take time away from his other work.<br>
                Alans solution to this issue is to maintain open lines of communication between the team to make sure that there is no misunderstanding between himself and others in the team. <br>
                Another issue flagged by Alan was when working with other systems. Often he has to deal with limited documentation or logging and results to debugging responses to understand what the systems is doing when a request is sent to it.<br>
                He mentioned the concept of a “Black Box”, where no one understands what happens in it, all we know is what goes in and what comes out.</p>

            <h3>Captures the essence</h3>
            <p>Alan is not strictly speaking in the information technology industry, he just works in Information Technology. However, for him knowing the purpose of what you are working on and what it means for and the people that it is for is important. Connecting individuals with problems with those with solutions he feels is the entirety of his job.<br></p>

            <h3>Terms</h3>
            <p><b>“Scrum” </b><br>
                Short meeting where people in 2 sentences sum up the work from yesterday and the plan for today and highlight any potential issues with the aim of the group giving support.<br>
                <b>Sprints</b><br>
                Typically, you build systems from the ground up in the order that makes the most sense.<br>
                Sprints are 2 week “sprints” to develop small parts. More about showing the consumer that progress is being made. This is part of his companies agile mythology, which Alan does not think helps development overall and slows down the development cycle.<br>
                <b>Bug/Defect</b> <br>
                Often in the team they will use the language Defect over bug when a development does not do what they expect it to.
