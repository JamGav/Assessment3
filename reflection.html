                    <p>In the last three weeks the group has really pulled together to deliver the assessment. The work in the group was divided up in such a manner that not a single person was responsible for deliver a single segment. During our meetings we generally each took actions that saw us crossing over into an area that we hadnt looked at previously. The open discussions also allowed us to highlight assignment requirements that may have been overlooked by other group members.</p>
<p>We decided early to go against the advice in the assignment and have only a single weekly meeting. I feel that two smaller meetings would be an improvement.</p>
<p>It was surprising to me that most of the group were managing the workload with full time jobs. It was also surprising how satisfying it was to see all the commits rolling into over the last couple of weeks as members really honed their individual bits of work.</p>
<p>I learned that a group with common values and a common goal can all pull in the same direction with a minimum of oversight. Having the correct tools to enable the collaboration such as Teams and Github were really helpful.</p>

                <span class="reflection"><p>Personally I've felt like this group was a very perfect one to end up a part of. Despite some initial issues getting used to Microsoft Teams leading to some admittedly sparse meeting attendance, especially over the Christmas break period, everyone very quickly found a rhythm and have all been seriously accommodating to various members' needs. When Andrew ran into some familial troubles and couldn't make the meeting, or when I was feeling a bit lost with the scope of the project, there was always a well-organised list of actions and notes after meetings for everyone to keep a good track of where things were at. Looking forward to future projects if the group is this cohesive!</p>
                <p>I think if I had to make any harder criticisms or feedback, it would pretty much be directed towards myself; I got very caught up with the two uni courses running side-by-side, and that sort of thing really runs the risk of making me fall behind. Happily however, the group has been very nice about it so hopefully there won't be any major troubles in the vein for the future.</p>

                <span class="reflection"><p>My experience of working with the group was more than pleasant. I found that everyone pulled their weight and contributed equal amounts while also discussing and taking part in the weekly meetings we arranged. With everyone seemingly working jobs while also studying, it was nice that we were able to actively meet and have all members present more often than not.</p>
                  <p>I was pleasantly surprised to find that with every part a team member may have struggled in, another member was experienced with, and was more than happy and able to assist them and bring them up to speed, I feel it created a welcoming and understanding atmosphere without any ill feelings or animosity attached.</p>
                  <p>If there was an aspect to be improved upon, I believe there could have been an agreed choice on whether the group pushed updates to the GitHub in small parts or larger parts. This coincides with me feeling as though the GitHub activity logs to not show the true amount of work done by each person, as half were the type to update with every change, and the other half instead uploaded less but had more a style of uploading in batches of work.</p>
                  <p>In conclusion, I was more than happy with how the group performed as a unit and look forward to continuing the further coursework with them in future assignments.</p>

                <span class="reflection"><p>From the get-go the group has worked efficiently together, everyone is friendly and happy to have input. Meetings have run smoothly given everyone is on a different schedule or even a different time zone, so we’ve managed to make it work thankfully. The workload has been delegated evenly and everyone has stepped up and done their share.</p>
                <p>I’m not sure much could be improved, luckily it’s a good group to work with. I guess it was just a bit unfortunate the assignment started over the busiest part of the holiday period making everyone’s availability a bit all over the place that first week, so it took a little while to get the ball rolling.</p>
                <p>One thing that was pleasantly surprising, in the middle of the project I was a bit overwhelmed with the amount of work, the functionality of GitHub and using CSS to format the webpage, thankfully Gavin was able to take the extra time out of his day to troubleshoot and help me through these problems, this really helped me push through and get to the finish line. This assignment has helped me develop my skills working as a group online whereas my previous team experiences have only ever been in the same room.</p>

            <H3>What went well?</H3>
            <p>Overall, the group has worked incredibly well together and completing the assignment was a relatively easy task thanks to a good amount of communication, support, and teamwork.</p>
            <p>From the initial meetings to the end of week 7 all members were friendly, professional, and respectful making meetings a safe space for input without judgement or ego. Meeting agendas have been clear and evenly spaced out each week ensuring a smooth process when completing each section of the assignment.Scheduling meetings for the most part was a pretty easy process as members made the time regardless of other commitments or time zones and were punctual about it. Communication is key when working as part of a group and thankfully we’ve had great communication between our group.</p>
           <p>Additionally all members came in with different skill levels, experience and knowledge, which they have been happy to share. We look forward to continuing to share and grow our collective knowledge over the next 2 group tasks.</p>
            <p>We all have the same goal at the end of the day, but the combination of similar and contrasting personalities has led to some good comradery between the group and were happy to be working together in the upcoming assignments.</p>
            <H3>What could be improved?</H3>
            <p>The first thing that comes to mind when thinking about what we could have improved upon would be better organisation of meetings. The beginning of the project, fell right on the busiest part of the holiday season and everyone’s scheduling was a bit all over the place due to work and Christmas engagements.</p>
            <p>Some members were more well versed in the use of GitHub and webpage creation, so some aspects of the project were delegated to them by default. We hope to sharpen our skills going into the next assignment and continue to share our personal knowledge so that everyone has a better understanding of the app’s functionality. Half the group was already familiar with Microsoft teams using it for work or other projects while a couple of us had not used it before, this led to a little bit of hand holding getting those who were unfamiliar with its functionality up to speed, so again, just sharpen our knowledge of Microsoft teams to make the follow up project an easier process.</p>
            <H3>At least one thing that was surprising?</H3>
            <p>It was pleasantly surprising to see all group members time management and commitment regarding the assignment. Everyone has a very different lifestyles and there have been a few obstacles in the last few weeks but everyone has stepped up and done their part. Rory has been juggling large event productions but has fully communicated when that will be taking place and when he aims to catch up on the work, Gavin & Kyle have been busy working full-time but have managed to set aside enough time for full commit to the task. Evan is currently studying a separate course which he has stated is keeping him very busy but he hasn’t dropped the ball with this course work and Andrew has been busy seeking employment and was exposed to Covid-19 which delayed his progress but he managed to make up the time.</p>
            <p>Additionally, it was surprising how well we communicated, worked together, and got along. There is always a fear with group assessmnets that you need to pull dead weight, and this is enhanced with all communication being online, however, we managed to avoid this cliché and all members contributed to the project.</p>
            <H3>At least one thing you’ve learned about groups?</H3>
            <p>Working on this assignment has taught some of us that working and collaborating online is a very different experience to working together in person, I guess in some instances it makes you less liable as people can’t call you out there and then like in person but as we mentioned before everyone has been reliable and trustworthy.</p>
            <p>It’s been great to see members who have prior IT knowledge really step up and take a leadership role and also take the time to assist others, this is very important when working as part of a group as they say, "a rising tide lifts all boats".</p>
            <p>Different members have displayed different specialties (coding, research, grammar, scheduling, app functionality) so delegating the appropriate section of the assignment to that member has made the assignment far less time consuming.</p>
            <p>This group seems to work really well together as we all have the same goal and through some clear discussions everyone has been on the same page about how to reach it.</p>

        <p>The number of commits and contributions does not reflect the amount of work contributed to the project, with some user's workflows making multiple changes across many aspects of the repository before committing and others committing regularly. Similarly, not all work on this project was completed on GitHub, with Interviews, Teams meetings, research, and more happening off GitHub. </p>
