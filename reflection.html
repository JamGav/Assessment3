                    <p>Over all, the team performed well. There was good attendance at all required meetings and work was delivered largely on time as discussed in the weekly meetings. Improvements were made based on feedback from the group and a good product was delivered.</p>
                    <p>I feel that teams perform better when there is a social aspect to the group instead of just a number of tasks that have to be performed for a common outcome. This is hard to achieve in such a short time frame and even harder to achieve across a country and three time zones. I feel that this could be an area for improvement however with every team member having other responsibilities outside of this project, not a lot of time can be devoted to team building.</p>
                    <p>In spite of the lack of team comraderie I was surprised at how much could be accomplished when tasks were broken down into small enough manageable pieces. I am also further surprised that the team was able to absorb the increased workload so easily after losing 20% of the available labour.</p>
                    <p>I have learned that while groups can function with a common goal, another way to drive success is with a defined leader. Rory assumed this role in the group and I feel this contributed significantly to its success. Good job.</p>

                    <p>We maintained the momentum from A2 and continued to work productively as a group. Reading over the reflection from A2 and the Feeback from the Assessment it is good to see that the changes we proposed have been implemented at the group have benefited as a result.</p>
                    <p>During this task I took on the role of Project Manager and managed the division of tasks week to week. As a result, I took on additional roles and tasks that in reflection could have been delegated more. I need to have more trust in my team and make more use of their skill sets.</p>
                    <p>I would also have been beneficial to have reached further functionality of the application during our development window. We reached our Scope but could have aimed higher as a team.</p>
                    <p>I am honestly surprised and grateful to have the whole team working and supporting the development of what was initially my idea.</p>
                    <p>My jobs and past experiences have had me working in a range of groups with different goals. This, however, was the first time I have worked fully remote on a project. Reflecting on how we used Teams and generally communicated you can see learning a growth from all team members in this area.</p>
                    <p>I had also never worked developing an app before, so my knowledge in the app development cycle has grown considerably.</p>

                    <p>After the very diverse learning experience that was Assessment 2, Assessments 3 & 5 have been comparatively much smoother. Despite not only the increased workload of the more difficult and multiple tasks, but also the early departure of a team member, we generally had a much better time making effective progress with the work.</p>
                    <p>One big takeaway from this (for me, at any rate) has to be the absolute importance of a solid chairman/leadership role, who can hold everything together and ensure that the group runs like a well-oiled machine. If it wasn’t for Rory stepping up and doing such a bang-up job in that role, I can confidently say that I would have found it harder to keep pace with the rest of the group as I can personally find it very tricky to track what particular work is still undone or where people may need my help to fill something out.</p>
                    <p>As for improvements, I really have to say that either moving away from MS Teams, or fully committing to Teams by installing the desktop app would have been better. The website is very unwieldy and if you don’t have the page actively open, it’s easy to miss important activity.There was more than one occasion when someone sent a crucial message or question through to the project discussion page and it would just get left unread for way too long. Also, all the notifications going into my spam inbox certainly didn’t help.</p>

                    <p>Working together with the other members of Sharper Tech was similar to that of assignment two, a positive experience from the otherwise daunting idea of group work. The team did well to communicate what was expected of us within the assignments requirements and the timeframe in which they must be completed in. This group work has taught me that having a set deadline as well as a team that relies upon me completing my work is when I am most motivated and focused on my work, I'll admit that often in this project I was only able to continue working when faced with the knowledge that the other members were depending on me to pull my weight else a heavier workload would fall upon them.</p>
                    <p>Though it shouldn't have surprised me having him shown his leadership skills in the our previous assignment, I was still blown away Rory's seemingly never-ending work ethic and his ability to coordinate the group with who took on what work and when it was required. Gavin's ability to perform more complex tasks I personally would not have been able perform was a pleasant surprise, and Evan's willingness to propose new ideas and question others was surprising and opened up conversations and discussions which allowed us to improve.</p>
                    <p>If any one thing was to be improved, I'd personally recommend we'd have used another chatting service alongside Microsoft Teams, as outside of weekly video-calls there wasn't much an active thread of conversation between the group outside of direct messages. That being said, the majority of our problems were still able to be ironed out each week via the video calls.</p>

        <h2>What went well</h2>
        <p>After A2, the group used our personal reflections and the feedback from our tutor on the assessment to make a few structural changes in order to improve the quality of outcome for A3. This included weekly recurring meetings being scheduled at the beginning of the development process, a single chair and the creation of a more structured group site that had all the required areas as heading and subheadings. This structure improved communication and allowed team members to track progress of all areas of the project easily. </p>
        <p>Our team also developed their familiarity with Teams using its channels to break work down into specific projects, shared files and chat functions more efficiently in A3. The team also expanded their use of shared documents in Word, the use of OneDrive, and even used Stream for the A5 assignment </p>
        <p>During A3 we unfortunately had one of our Team members unenroll from the course which took us down to a team of 4. We were able to recover from this loss and redistribute responsibilities around the Team, still allowing us to achieve our scope. </p>
        <p>As our group reflection stated for A2 we continued to work well as a group with friendly, professional, and respectful communication practices that allowed team members to express ideas, ask questions, and learn from each other. </p>
        <h2>What could be improved</h2>
        <p>As part of our scope, we intentionally assigned different areas of development to different team members without the goal of integrating these areas over the course of our 6 weeks of development. In hindsight we could have had the time to begin the integration process which would have improved the final deliverable and learning in the team. </p>
        <p>A better integration of a group text-chat could have been developed, as messaging was often done peer-to-peer, often our talks and discussions as a whole group were only performed via our weekly meetings.  This was a common thread in the individual feedback from all team members.</p>
        <h2>At least one thing that was surprising</h2>
        <p>It was surprising to see the adoption of the Pursuit of Hoppiness idea between the group. Each member developed an understanding of the project idea and (hopefully) developed a sense of ownership of their area of research. </p>
        <p>It was also surprising how satisfying it is to see the git commit logs being filled up with other team members work.  With the work being 100% remote it gave assurance that there was work being done periodically and not just slapped together at the end. </p>
        <h2>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h2>
        <p>The added structure that came from moving the Teams meeting to weekly recurring meeting with a single chair reinforced the need for clear leadership in team project situations.</p>
        <p>There was also an initial fear of fully online group collaboration, but through the completion of 3 group assessment tasks it is good to see that it is possible.</p>
        <p>Collectively, each team member learned something about the challenges of remote work with the added complication of working with people that they are unfamiliar with.</p>
