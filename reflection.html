Meetings have run smoothly given everyone is on a different schedule or even a different time zone, so we’ve managed to make it work thankfully. The workload has been delegated evenly and everyone has stepped up and done their share.</p>
                <p>I’m not sure much could be improved, luckily it’s a good group to work with. I guess it was just a bit unfortunate the assignment started over the busiest part of the holiday period making everyone’s availability a bit all over the place that first week, so it took a little while to get the ball rolling.</p>
                <p>One thing that was pleasantly surprising, in the middle of the project I was a bit overwhelmed with the amount of work, the functionality of GitHub and using CSS to format the webpage, thankfully Gavin was able to take the extra time out of his day to troubleshoot and help me through these problems, this really helped me push through and get to the finish line. This assignment has helped me develop my skills working as a group online whereas my previous team experiences have only ever been in the same room.</p>
