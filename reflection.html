                    <p>Working together with the other members of Sharper Tech was similar to that of assignment two, a positive experience from the otherwise daunting idea of group work. The team did well to communicate what was expected of us within the assignments requirements and the timeframe in which they must be completed in. This group work has taught me that having a set deadline as well as a team that relies upon me completing my work is when I am most motivated and focused on my work, I'll admit that often in this project I was only able to continue working when faced with the knowledge that the other members were depending on me to pull my weight else a heavier workload would fall upon them.</p>
                    <p>Though it shouldn't have surprised me having him shown his leadership skills in the our previous assignment, I was still blown away Rory's seemingly never-ending work ethic and his ability to coordinate the group with who took on what work and when it was required. Gavin's ability to perform more complex tasks I personally would not have been able perform was a pleasant surprise, and Evan's willingness to propose new ideas and question others was surprising and opened up conversations and discussions which allowed us to improve.</p>
                    <p>If any one thing was to be improved, I'd personally recommend we'd have used another chatting service alongside Microsoft Teams, as outside of weekly video-calls there wasn't much an active thread of conversation between the group outside of direct messages. That being said, the majority of our problems were still able to be ironed out each week via the video calls.</p>
