                    <p>In the last three weeks the group has really pulled together to deliver the assessment. The work in the group was divided up in such a manner that not a single person was responsible for deliver a single segment. During our meetings we generally each took actions that saw us crossing over into an area that we hadnt looked at previously. The open discussions also allowed us to highlight assignment requirements that may have been overlooked by other group members.</p>
                    <p>We decided early to go against the advice in the assignment and have only a single weekly meeting. I feel that two smaller meetings would be an improvement.</p>
                    <p>It was surprising to me that most of the group were managing the workload with full time jobs. It was also surprising how satisfying it was to see all the commits rolling into over the last couple of weeks as members really honed their individual bits of work.</p>
                    <p>I learned that a group with common values and a common goal can all pull in the same direction with a minimum of oversight. Having the correct tools to enable the collaboration such as Teams and Github were really helpful.</p>

                    <p>Personally I've felt like this group was a very perfect one to end up a part of. Despite some initial issues getting used to Microsoft Teams leading to some admittedly sparse meeting attendance, especially over the Christmas break period, everyone very quickly found a rhythm and have all been seriously accommodating to various members' needs. When Andrew ran into some familial troubles and couldn't make the meeting, or when I was feeling a bit lost with the scope of the project, there was always a well-organised list of actions and notes after meetings for everyone to keep a good track of where things were at. Looking forward to future projects if the group is this cohesive!</p>

                    <p>From the get-go the group has worked efficiently together, everyone is friendly and happy to have input. Meetings have run smoothly given everyone is on a different schedule or even a different time zone, so we’ve managed to make it work thankfully. The workload has been delegated evenly and everyone has stepped up and done their share.</p>
                    <p>I’m not sure much could be improved, luckily it’s a good group to work with. I guess it was just a bit unfortunate the assignment started over the busiest part of the holiday period making everyone’s availability a bit all over the place that first week, so it took a little while to get the ball rolling.</p>
                    <p>One thing that was pleasantly surprising, in the middle of the project I was a bit overwhelmed with the amount of work, the functionality of GitHub and using CSS to format the webpage, thankfully Gavin was able to take the extra time out of his day to troubleshoot and help me through these problems, this really helped me push through and get to the finish line. This assignment has helped me develop my skills working as a group online whereas my previous team experiences have only ever been in the same room.</p>

        <p>The number of commits and contributions does not reflect the amount of work contributed to the project, with some user's workflows making multiple changes across many aspects of the repository before committing and others committing regularly. Similarly, not all work on this project was completed on GitHub, with Interviews, Teams meetings, research, and more happening off GitHub. </p>
