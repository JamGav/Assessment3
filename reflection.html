                    <p>Over all, the team performed well.  There was good attendance at all required meetings and work was delivered largely on time as discussed in the weekly meetings.  Improvements were made based on feedback from the group and a good product was delivered.</p>
                    <p>I feel that teams perform better when there is a social aspect to the group instead of just a number of tasks that have to be performed for a common outcome.  This is hard to achieve in such a short time frame and even harder to achieve across a country and three time zones.  I feel that this could be an area for improvement however with every team member having other responsibilities outside of this project, not a lot of time can be devoted to team building.</p>
                    <p>In spite of the lack of team comraderie I was surprised at how much could be accomplished when tasks were broken down into small enough manageable pieces.  I am also further surprised that the team was able to absorb the increased workload so easily after losing 20% of the available labour.</p>
                    <p>I have learned that while groups can function with a common goal, another way to drive success is with a defined leader.  Rory assumed this role in the group and I feel this contributed significantly to its success.  Good job.</p>

                    <p>We maintained the momentum from A2 and continued to work productively as a group. Reading over the reflection from A2 and the Feeback from the Assessment it is good to see that the changes we proposed have been implemented at the group have benefited as a result.</p>
                    <p>During this task I took on the role of Project Manager and managed the division of tasks week to week. As a result, I took on additional roles and tasks that in reflection could have been delegated more. I need to have more trust in my team and make more use of their skill sets.</p>
                    <p>I would also have been beneficial to have reached further functionality of the application during our development window. We reached our Scope but could have aimed higher as a team.</p>
                    <p>I am honestly surprised and grateful to have the whole team working and supporting the development of what was initially my idea.</p>
                    <p>My jobs and past experiences have had me working in a range of groups with different goals. This, however, was the first time I have worked fully remote on a project. Reflecting on how we used Teams and generally communicated you can see learning a growth from all team members in this area.</p>
                    <p>I had also never worked developing an app before, so my knowledge in the app development cycle has grown considerably.</p>

                    <p>Working together with the other members of Sharper Tech was similar to that of assignment two, a positive experience from the otherwise daunting idea of group work. The team did well to communicate what was expected of us within the assignments requirements and the timeframe in which they must be completed in. This group work has taught me that having a set deadline as well as a team that relies upon me completing my work is when I am most motivated and focused on my work, I'll admit that often in this project I was only able to continue working when faced with the knowledge that the other members were depending on me to pull my weight else a heavier workload would fall upon them.</p>
                    <p>Though it shouldn't have surprised me having him shown his leadership skills in the our previous assignment, I was still blown away Rory's seemingly never-ending work ethic and his ability to coordinate the group with who took on what work and when it was required. Gavin's ability to perform more complex tasks I personally would not have been able perform was a pleasant surprise, and Evan's willingness to propose new ideas and question others was surprising and opened up conversations and discussions which allowed us to improve.</p>
                    <p>If any one thing was to be improved, I'd personally recommend we'd have used another chatting service alongside Microsoft Teams, as outside of weekly video-calls there wasn't much an active thread of conversation between the group outside of direct messages. That being said, the majority of our problems were still able to be ironed out each week via the video calls.</p>
