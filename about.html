                <span class="member_bio">My name is Gavin, student number s3925654. I am an Australian who grew up in Brisbane and lives in Sydney. Currently I am studying Information to IT online via OUA and working on team (team name here). I have a keen interest in the world around me and learning about why things are the way they are. My interest in IT stems from a hobby interest in electronics and programming which initially drove me to pursue a trade in Aircraft Electrical Systems (Avionics). Throughout the years I have tinkered on and off with a number of different Electronic and IT related projects while finding a keen interest in projects that bridge the gap between the physical and the connected world, and automation projects. As someone who is not a huge fan contributor or user of social media, one of my favourite builds was developing my own blog for my travelling based on wordpress. I was able to develop a unique page on it that would recieve position updates via my HF radio and post them on a map along with short tweets so that family and friends with the link could follow along.

                <span class="member_bio">Hi, I'm Kyle - student s3930665. I was born and have lived on the Gold Coast my whole life. I am currently studying Information Technology through Open Universities as a way to test the waters of further IT study while I continue to work from home part-time. Nearly all my hobbies involve computers, with them being video-games, music (where my taste is all over the place), movies, or just messing about on the internet. These hobbies spawned my interest in IT and kept it alive while my Highschool did its best attempt to crush the interest. I'm most interested in the area of programming, where I'd love to learn to make my own applications or games. The ability to work for yourself if the opportunity presents it is a very tempting one and one of my favourite perks of the Information Technology industry. Outside of my usual computer-centric hobbies, I enjoy spending time with my mates doing whatever catches our attention, watching various Philadelphia based sports teams (go Sixers!), reading random literature that catches my eye, or at the gym where I train 5-6 nights each week.</span>

                <span class="member_bio">My name is Andrew Suhr, Student number: s3933181. I was born and raised in Hobart, Tasmania and moved to Melbourne, Victoria in 2006. After completing High school, I went on to complete an Advanced Diploma of Music Performance but have not studied for a decade since. I’m passionate about playing video games and music, playing guitar for both work and pleasure in bands for the last 10 years or so. 
My interest in IT stems from the generational leap in gaming hardware and graphics over the last 20 years, the necessity/advancement in smartphone and app technology and the new possibilities of learning and recording music through software. I’ve had very little experience in IT prior to this course, My course team name is …..?
