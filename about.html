                <span class="member_bio">My name is Gavin, I am an Australian who grew up in Brisbane and lives in Sydney. Currently I am studying Introduction to IT online via OUA and working on team Sharper Tech. I have a keen interest in the world around me and learning about why things are the way they are. My interest in IT stems from a hobby interest in electronics and programming which initially drove me to pursue a trade in Aircraft Electrical Systems (Avionics). <p>Throughout the years I have tinkered on and off with a number of different electronic and IT-related projects while finding a keen interest in projects that bridge the gap between the physical and the connected world, and automation projects. As someone who is not a huge fan, contributor or user of social media, one of my favourite builds was developing my own blog for my travelling based on Wordpress. I was able to develop a unique page on it that would recieve position updates via my HF radio and post them on a map along with short tweets so that family and friends with the link could follow along.

                <span class="member_name">Rory Henderson<br>S3933584</span>
                <span class="member_bio">I’m Rory and I am the R in Sharper Tech (one of them...). I was born in Scotland, grew up in Brisbane and now live in Western Australia. In 2019 I was thrown into IT and now coordinate IT for 2 campuses with around 350 users. I have no formal training in IT and am pursuing a Bachelor of IT at RMIT as it offers a great base, giving an understanding of core IT concepts with the ability to specialise in specific areas later in the degree structure. The flexibility of online study and lighter load than a traditional semester structure is appealing whilst I continue to work. <br>
                    <p>Although I have no formal training, IT has been a part of my life for a long time. My father is a web developer and always encouraged us to explore IT. Computer games were a big part of this interest when I was younger, although I was also interested in Audio/Visual productions which allowed me experiences such as building PCs capable of 4k editing, running multi-terabyte shared network drives and managing multi-camera live streams. <br>
                        I also work as a bar manager and create video graphics for theatre shows. My recent projects include <i>The Boy from Oz</i> and <i>Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.</i>

                <span class="member_bio">G'day, my name's Evan, and I hail from all over the place. Born in the UK, but grew up living several years at a time in various Australian towns and cities, especially Perth and Alice Springs. Alice was where I first picked up a guitar during early high school, and since then that hobby has grown into a passion, and from there it lead me into a full-fledged Music Performance degree in the UK. After that was done, I came back to Aus and settled down in Tasmania, ready to pursue new things. <p>I've always had a very definite interest in the field of IT and programming, what with computers and software being the place I've spent most of my time. Hoping now that this course can gradually take me down the path of concrete career skills, and secure a solid future, and to that end I've joined up with Sharper Tech, proud to be a contributing team member.</span>

                <span class="member_name">Kyle Ross<br>S3930665</span>
                <span class="member_bio">Hi, I'm Kyle, I'm the other R in Sharper Tech, I was born and have lived on the Gold Coast my whole life. I am currently studying Information Technology through Open Universities as a way to test the waters of further IT study while I continue to work from home part-time. Nearly all my hobbies involve computers, with them being video games, music (where my taste is all over the place), movies, or just messing about on the internet. These hobbies spawned my interest in IT and kept it alive while my high school did its best attempt to crush the interest. <p>I'm most interested in the area of programming, where I'd love to learn to make my own applications or games. The ability to work for yourself if the opportunity presents it is a very tempting one and one of my favourite perks of the Information Technology industry. Outside of my usual computer-centric hobbies, I enjoy spending time with my mates doing whatever catches our attention, watching various Philadelphia based sports teams (go Sixers!), reading random literature that catches my eye, or at the gym where I train 5-6 nights each week.</span>

                <span class="member_name">Andrew Suhr<br>S3933181</span>
                <span class="member_bio">My name is Andrew, I was born and raised in Hobart, Tasmania and moved to Melbourne, Victoria in 2006. After completing high school, I went on to complete an Advanced Diploma of Music Performance but have not studied for a decade since. I’m passionate about playing video games and music, playing guitar for both work and pleasure in bands for the last 10 years or so.
                    <p>My interest in IT stems from the generational leap in gaming hardware and graphics over the last 20 years, the necessity/advancement in smartphone and app technology and the new possibilities of learning and recording music through software. I have minimal experience in the field of IT, and I'm currently studying Introduction to IT through RMIT online and working with my group Sharper Tech.

            <h1>Group Processes</h1>
            <P>The group worked cohesively for Assessment 2 and brought the same can do attitudes and work ethic into Assessment 3. One change that was made was a stronger review process of work that wasnt our own. What this meant was empowering each individual team member to make changes as they saw fit to work that someone else had committed. Due to the work behind committed regularly to the repository, any changes were able to be seen in the blame log and either challenged or supported as required.</P>
            <p>Another change was our approach to team meetings. During A2 we elected to share the Role of Chair and scheduling around the group, which allowed different members to experience the roll, but also lead to uncertainty and inconsistent structures for Agendas and Actions. For A3 Rory scheduled a weekly recurring meeting for Wednesdays after our course Tutorial. He chaired the meetings and also managed the agendas, meeting minutes, action items and any additional meetings that needed to be scheduled.</p>
            <p>With one group member sadly having to move on to other things, the group was able step it up another level and divide the workload amongst the remaining members based on their own individual stengths displayed from Assessmen 2. The result was work delivered to the same standard within the time constraints of the project and life outside.</p>

            <h1>Career Plans</h1>
            <h3>Games Developers - Kyle and Andrew</h3>
            <p>Both Andrew and Kyle listed their ideal jobs as games developers. Their desire to work in Game Development requires a thorough knowledge and proficiency in coding languages such as C# or C++, as well as the knowledge and understanding of game engines such as Unity or the Unreal Engine. It is also expected they have experience in general software development as their work is heavily code related.</p>
            <p><b>Kyle:</b> My career plan and ideal job has remained unchanged throughout this project, I still believe my passion for computing lies within the creation and contribution to video-game development. During this course I was able to uncover what skills are required to fulfil and aquire my role, and thus plan to further my understanding of game engines, as well as my proficiency in programming.</p>
            <h3>Back End Developers - Gavin and Evan</h3>
            <p>Evan and Gavin both listed roles that fit under the description of backend developers. Their desire to work in back end development requires skills across a multitide of disciplines in the IT sphere, including programming in a variety of languages, database development, cloud management, and networking. </p>
            <p>After some self reflection, Gavin has indicated that he may pursue a role that combines the technical side of IT with the business analytics side. This may lead on to a Data Science type role as there is significant crossover of the fields. Further study will be required.</p>
            <p>Thanks to the research done throughout this project, as well as what was studied throughout the general coursework, Evan has opened his mind to the wider possibilities of backend development, as well as backend-adjacent areas like databasing. The prospect of carefully working to build these interlocking systems has proved quite enticing.</p>
            <h3>Azure Incident Manager - Rory</h3>
            <p>Rory's ideal job was as an Azure incident manager. His desire to work as an Azure Incident Manager requires extensive Cloud Computing knowledge with a focus on the Azure product line, the ability to communicate well with his team, to be able to work under pressure, and the ability to debug and remediate issues.</p>
            <p>Over the study period Rory’s knowledge of Cloud Platforms and understanding of their growing importance in the future of IT has reinforced his interest in this career path. Before the course he had only had experience with the Microsoft cloud platform offerings but is now also familiar (in theory) with the Amazon and Google offerings, broadening his interest away from just Azure.</p>
            <p>A3 and A5 also gave Rory the ability to function in a team management role, serving as the project lead and chair and the tasks.</p>
            <h2>Career Similarities</h2>
            <p>Our desired jobs often overlapped in what skills we are expected to posess, such as with Andrew and Kyle's ideal jobs of being Game Developers, they saw overlap with Evan and Gavin's ideal jobs of Back End Developers, as Game Developers are classified as back end, they all required proficiency in skills such programming, databases, and networking. Though Rory's ideal job was an outlier to the rest of the group, his desire to work with Azure required cloud computing knowledge, something that is expected from Gavin and Evan with their desires to be backend developers.</p>
