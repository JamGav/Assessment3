                <span class="member_bio">My name is Gavin, student number s3925654. I am an Australian who grew up in Brisbane and lives in Sydney. Currently I am studying Information to IT online via OUA and working on team Sharper Tech. I have a keen interest in the world around me and learning about why things are the way they are. My interest in IT stems from a hobby interest in electronics and programming which initially drove me to pursue a trade in Aircraft Electrical Systems (Avionics). Throughout the years I have tinkered on and off with a number of different Electronic and IT related projects while finding a keen interest in projects that bridge the gap between the physical and the connected world, and automation projects. As someone who is not a huge fan contributor or user of social media, one of my favourite builds was developing my own blog for my travelling based on wordpress. I was able to develop a unique page on it that would recieve position updates via my HF radio and post them on a map along with short tweets so that family and friends with the link could follow along.

                <span class="member_bio">I’m Rory and my student number is s3933584. I was born in Scotland, grew up in Brisbane and now live in Western Australia. In 2019 I was thrown into IT and now Coordinate IT for 2 campuses with around 350 users. I have no formal training in IT and am pursuing a Bachelor of IT at RMIT as it offers a great base, giving an understanding of core IT concepts with the ability to specialise in specific areas later in the degree structure. The flexibility of online study and lighter load than traditional semester structure is appealing whilst I continue to work. <br>
                    Although I have no formal training, IT has been a part of my life for a long time. My father is a web developer and always encouraged us to explore IT. Computer games where a big part of this interest when I was younger, although I was also interested in Audio Visual productions which allowed me experiences such as building PC’s capable of 4k editing, running multi-terabyte shared network drives and managing multi camera live streams. <br>
                    I also work as a bar manager and create video graphics for theatre shows. My recent projects include The Boy from OZ and Priscilla Queen of the Desert.  </span>

                <span class="member_bio">G'day, my name's Evan, student ID of S3934101, and I hail from all over the place. Born in the UK, but grew up several years at a time in various Australian towns and cities, especially Perth and Alice Springs. Alice was where I first picked up a guitar during early high school, and since then that hobby has grown into a passion, and from there it lead me into a full-fledged Music Performance degree in the UK. After that was done, I came back to Aus and settled down in Tasmania, ready to pursue new things. I've always had a very definite interest in the field of IT and programming, what with computers and software being the place I've spent most of my time. Hoping now that this course can gradually take me down the path of concrete career skills, and secure a solid future!</span>

                <span class="member_bio">Hi, I'm Kyle - student s3930665. I was born and have lived on the Gold Coast my whole life. I am currently studying Information Technology through Open Universities as a way to test the waters of further IT study while I continue to work from home part-time. Nearly all my hobbies involve computers, with them being video-games, music (where my taste is all over the place), movies, or just messing about on the internet. These hobbies spawned my interest in IT and kept it alive while my Highschool did its best attempt to crush the interest. I'm most interested in the area of programming, where I'd love to learn to make my own applications or games. The ability to work for yourself if the opportunity presents it is a very tempting one and one of my favourite perks of the Information Technology industry. Outside of my usual computer-centric hobbies, I enjoy spending time with my mates doing whatever catches our attention, watching various Philadelphia based sports teams (go Sixers!), reading random literature that catches my eye, or at the gym where I train 5-6 nights each week.</span>

                <span class="member_bio">My name is Andrew, Student number: s3933181. I was born and raised in Hobart, Tasmania and moved to Melbourne, Victoria in 2006. After completing High school, I went on to complete an Advanced Diploma of Music Performance but have not studied for a decade since. I’m passionate about playing video games and music, playing guitar for both work and pleasure in bands for the last 10 years or so.
My interest in IT stems from the generational leap in gaming hardware and graphics over the last 20 years, the necessity/advancement in smartphone and app technology and the new possibilities of learning and recording music through software. I’ve had very little experience in IT prior to this course, My course team name is …..?

            <h1>Team Profile</h1>
            <h2>Personality Tests</h2>
            <p>It was found during the Myers-Briggs personality tests that each team member shared a number of common traits, but in almost every case each team member also possessed a single trait that strongly differentiated them from the group. The most common trait revealed by the Myers-Briggs test was Introversion.  This was interesting as you may not expect a team of introverts to function or step up to a leadership role in the group.  During team meetings it has been found that this is almost a strength.  At different times, each team member has had to take responsibility for setting goals and coordinating the work for the team.  This has been succesful, work has been shared equitably, and no conflict has arisen.</p>
            <p class="draft_content">This style indicates draft content.  Insert table here for each members results.  Ill tabulate this in a very simple manner -Gav</p>
            <h2>Member learning styles</h2>
            <p>Much like the personality test, each member was show to be a largely auditory learner with one standout exception.</p>
            <p class="draft_content">Gav to collect data from everyones page and make some pie charts here</p>
            <p class="draft_content">Form some conclusion from the data here.</p>
            <h2>Individual tests</h2>
            <p class="draft_content">Ill have to think of a good way to go about this....  We might have to add some personal flair to it about "Why this makes me fit well in the team".  That should help mee tthe requirements in the rubric</p>
