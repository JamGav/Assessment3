            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <h2>Topic</h2>
            <p>Pursuit of Hoppiness is a community sourced bar rating and review app that can be used to filter by specific categories to allow beer enthusiasts to broaden their beer horizons, beer bargain hunters to find and deal, and all beer lovers to come together in one place. It is the “Pursuit of Hoppiness”.</p>
            <p>The app focus on reviews of venues and encourages exploration of a user's local area or can serve as a guide when you arrive somewhere new providing 5 different beer focused categories to filter by instead of a single unrelated 5-star review.</p>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>Beer is the most consumed alcoholic beverage in the world and third most popular beverage after water and tea (S <https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/8/11/1382/htm). Despite an overall drop in Australian beer consumption the craft beer industryhas grown 4.7% annually between 2016 and 2021 with a 6.2% expected growth to occur in 2021 (https://www.ibisworld.com/au/industry/craft-beer-production/5071/>). Despite this when I explore new bars I find the same 4 lager taps installed. “Pursuit of Hoppiness” solves this by quickly sorting all nearby venues based on Tap Uniqueness,  Total Taps, Pint Price, and Atmosphere based on fellow beer enthusiast's input. The app also allows reviews and social networking with friends.</p>

            <h2>Landscape</h2>
            <p>38% of Craft Beer drinkers in Australia use beer apps (https://www.beercartel.com.au/blog/2016-australian-craft-beer-survey-results/ ), equating to a large market and many competitors. There are many similar applications on the market, but the use of our 5 categories of venue filtering, 6 including distance and social elements, brings something new not offered by others in the space.</p>
            <p>Untappd is the largest existing competitor in the market. They are a craft beer review app on IOS and Android with a social element. The app allows users to check into venues, try and review beers, tagging them to that specific location (https://untappd.com/home). The app had 8 million users, 900 million venue check-ins and 20,000 businesses mid 2020 (https://expandedramblings.com/index.php/untappd-statistics-facts/). Similarities between our concept and their product include the map UI, social elements, and badges. However, our concept differs with their product exclusively focused on reviews of Beers, whereas ours will focus on review of venues. </p>
            <p>Untappd's business model charges bars and breweries an annual fee for membership, providing them features including digital and print menu web-based design applications and hosting, access to specific customer groups, event marketing, push/email marketing, social media integrations, and access to a beer database. There are other apps that use the same model, including Barmenus (https://www.beermenus.com/blog/312-untappd-for-business-price-increase). Giving bar owners control of their location is a feature we are planning to include, but we had not considered monetizing this feature.</p>
            <p>The app MisterGoodBeer- find your bar, is another product on the market with similarities to the Pursuit of Hoppinses. It shows nearby locations and can be filtered by price, and happy hour. Contributions to the App are made by the users. The app has over 151,000 downloads and 12,400 contributors (https://www.mistergoodbeer.com/). The app features a similar UI and venue focus but lacks the social element that we plan to bring.</p>

            <h1>Aims</h1>
            <h2>Big aim</h2>
            <p>Develop an app that integrates beer centric location-based bar filtering, that supports a thriving and active community</p>
            <h2>Smaller Aims</h2>
            <p>User profiles supporting Badges (How do you get badges, how are they displayed)</p>
            <p>Social Elements (integrated messaging client, social feed to see friends' activity, ability to add friends and see their profiles)</p>
            <p>Reviews and filtering (ability to collect user reviews on the 5 scales, ability to store and average these, ability to present this data the user, ability for the user to selected which of the 5 categories they want to filter by)</p>
            <p>Location based (Maps integration, GPS data from the user to verify the review, ability to pull existing map data for mapping venues)</p>
            <p>Bar owner controls (what is their interface, different app or a browser based interface, what can they control)</p>

            <h1>Plans and Progress</h1>
            <h3>Initial Data Seeding</h3>
            <p>As the projects Phase 1 aim is limited to the Perth area, we must be able to provide data to the users to kick start organic growth.  Initially it was thought that web information could be scraped from a source like Google maps, but this prompted some ethical considerations once it was realised that the same thing could happen with the data that we are holding.  Consideration is given to budget when deciding how best to collect this data.  Pursuit of Hoppiness is a small operation and can ill afford to send its staff out on beer hunting missions during the limited available time to produce a proof of concept product.  A number of market research companies exist within the Perth area that support the hospitality sector.  This work could be outsourced to a market researcher and then ingested into the database to provide a starting point for users.</p>
            <h3>Google Maps Technology</h3>
            <p>Google Maps is the preferred map application to use for this product.</p>
            <p>Google maps is chosen as it is the most widely supported across multiple platforms and most users will be familiar with its look and feel.</p>

            <p>In the initial prototype phase of the product we aim to deliver a small mockup based on static data showing the locations of a number of venues with a brief description.  This will help us to decide what important bits of data we can safely display on a mobile device without the screen becoming cluttered.</p>
            <p>Post Prototype and for phase 1 we aim to integrate this with data supplied from our backend database.  This information will be fetched by the relevant front end application using our API and then displayed on the device.  As Google Maps supports a JSON input, this is what our API will provide.  It is intended that the front end will provide the location of the map view, this will be passed to the database query which will return a dataset to be formatted into JSON with relevant information for display on the map.</p>
            <p>For the purposes of the demo the API key for google maps has been committed to the public repository.  The mitigation for this risk is to heavily restrict the key in the google cloud console to the HTTP referrer of the site.  While this means that testing may be impacted between individual users, if they need to test on a local machine, they can replace the existing key with a private key of their own and enact their own controls to prevent pushing it to the repository.</p>
            <p>The mockup data is currently static.  For the Closed alpha release the code will have to be developed to allow incorporation of data from the rest API</p>
            <p>A demonstration of the Map formatted as it would display on a mobile screen is provided.</p>

            </div>
            <h3>Hosting</h3>
            <p>For initial testing to reduce costs we have opted for a local machine to host the application data and to deliver the content.  The "Box under the desk" approach.  A Virtual Private Server arrangement was investigated, but after comparing costs it decided that a migration to an off premise solution would only be appropriate after the completion of the closed alpha testing phase.</p>
            <p>Once the decision is made to move to the open beta stage of development, the application data, contant, and code, will be moved to a cloud hosting provider such as google.  As our development will be completely containerised, it will be a trivial matter to migrate the entire project to a cloud hosting provider that best suits our needs.</p>
            <p>In Summary the application will first be developed on local machines, then hosted in house for rapid testing of deployment pipelines and to reduce costs, then moved to a cloud hosted solution.  This will all be based upon certain milestones beign reached within the project.</p>

            </div>
            <h3>OpenAuthorization & Logins</h3>
            <p>When creating an account with our service, we decided we would implement OpenAuthorization so as allow users to join the site through existing accounts such as Google, Facebook and Twitter. Users are also offered the choice to join our application via the standard procedure of creating an account through email and password.</p>
            <p>(Refer to UX Prototype below)</p>
            <h3>Account Data Storage</h3>
            <p>Account details such as the users ID, OpenAuthorization ID, date of account creation, email used in signup, and hashed passwords (when applicable) will be kept in our database as per below.</p>

            <h2>User Experience and User Interface</h2>
            <p>UX (User experience design) and UI (User interface design) are two terms often used interchangeably and although the two are closely linked with some overlap, they are separate areas that have differences in goals and approach.</p>
            <p>UX focuses on a user's journey through a product or application whereas UI focus on the aesthetics and visual elements of an application. The goal of a UX designer is to create an easy, efficient, relevant, and all-round pleasant experiences for the user (https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/the-difference-between-ux-and-ui-design-a-laymans-guide/). UI designers work with the wireframe or structure provided by the UX designer and create a visually appealing easy to understand interface (https://youtu.be/5CxXhyhT6Fc). </p>
            <h3>Initial Research</h3>
            <p>The first stage in development was choosing the tools and technologies to develop with. Research and comparisons of UI and UX development software led to a focus on Proto.io, InVision and Adobe XD due to their price, ease of use and time to master all being mid or low. After an hour of testing each piece of software the discission was made to move forward with Adobe XD, primarily due to it integrations with other Adobe applications which where already being used to create assets for The Pursuit of Hoppinses.</p>
            <p>Before Beginning on the Wireframe for The Pursuit of Hoppinses, several tutorials were worked through to develop skills. Skills also significantly grew during the development process.</p>
            <h3>UX Planning</h3>
            <p>The goal of UX is to is to create an easy and efficient flow to allow users to complete their intended goals. The role can often be broken down into 5 phases, audience research, identification of users needs, generation of design ideas, prototyping and testing (https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/7-ux-deliverables-what-will-i-be-making-as-a-ux-designer). We identified our target audience as craft beer drinkers and our research produced an audience profile of males primary aged between 30 and 39 (https://takeatumble.com.au/insights/lifestyle/beer-market-statistics/), with the need to find the right bar for them. This led to a more traditional design with an approach that minimized the clicks to viewing venues score to one. Emphasis was also put on Navigation within the app.</p>
            <div class="image_box">
                <img src="img/UI UX/Initial wireframe write up.png">
            </div>
            <p>The home screen for existing users is the Map page. This screen initially centers on the user, giving them quick access to information of venues around them. It can be navigated similarly to other touch-based maps with pinching to zoom and swiping to move. Location can also be set using the search feature which has a text field for the search location and past searches. The List Page presents venues based on distance. It can be filtered by our four review categories to raise/lower venues depending on preference. The account page allows users to view their past reviews, manage settings an log out. When venues are clicked on the map or searched, they become centered on the map and give information on the venue as well as recent reviews.</p>
            <p>Each page features a navigation panel that can be used to quickly move between the Profile, Map and List View. </p>
            <h3>UX Prototype</h3>
            <p>The wireframe was made using tools inside XD and the Icons 4 Design plugin. Development of the wireframe was also used as training in XD.</p>
            <center><iframe width="414" height="896" src="https://xd.adobe.com/embed/707902ce-3eaf-48ed-b05c-ca30b6efacf0-252a/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
            <p>During development of the wireframe, swipe navigation was removed as it wasn’t supported by XD, and the Venue Page was changed to a pop-up box map overlay instead of its own page.</p>
            <h3>UI Development</h3>
            <p>When developing the UI for The Pursuit of Hoppiness emphasis was placed on consistency using already established interface elements such as Buttons and sliders as input controls, commonly used search field structures and map functionality and use of already established icons for common functions such as settings and notifications.</p>
            <p>To keep the app consistent with existing branding assets were reworked and expanded upon for use within the application. Some generic application symbols, such as the login, settings, notification and login icons, where taken from the Icons 4 Design plugin which allows non-attribution use of 5000 icons and symbols. These icons were colored to match the style guide.</p>
            <div class="image_box">
                <img src="img/UI UX/UI AI.png">
            </div>
            <p>Initial mock-ups of the UI were created in Adobe Illustrator and then imported into the wireframe XD file and worked to replace the wireframe icons. During this process changes were made to the UI and UX to improve functionality. This included moving the radius slider from Search to List and adding additional lines to breaks between sections. Additionally extra artboards were added to add Filter functionality for the prototype.</p>
            <h3>Final Prototype </h3>
            <p>The current prototype demonstrates the UI and UX of the application well, with several limitations as a result of XD. Limitations that will be addressed in future prototypes are editable text fields, active sliders, dynamic map and the addition of additional filters (currently only Tap Price is active).</p>
            <center><iframe width="414" height="896" src="https://xd.adobe.com/embed/1b06189c-b54c-4401-9739-23bed5b336fd-4e55/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
            <p>Following feedback from the development team the bottom navigation bar will be move up to allow room for phone navigation icons/buttons, phone battery, time and connection icons will be added to the top of the application, size and amount of text will be reviewed.</p>
            <h3>Next Stages</h3>
            <p>The current prototype was designed to the Scope for a minimum viable product and is missing major features that would significantly change the app UX and UI. The two biggest changes would come from the addition of Social Features and Venu Management Features.</p>
            <p>Social features including friends, messaging and an activity timeline would be accessible through the Nav bar and would replace the current list button, which would be relocated as a smaller icon next to the search field. This feature would add an additional 5 major screens, Timeline, Friends, Friend Profile, Chat Home and Chat. The UI and layout of these screens will be consistent with the application in line with the style guide and keeping the bottom navigation. Navigation features specific to the social features will be located at the top of the page.</p>
            <div class="image_box">
                <img src="img/UI UX/Social Wireframe.png">
            </div>
            <p>The venue management features will require a significantly different interface and will be a web portal rather than an app. Initially the features will be limited to the ability to edit their venue description and opening hours, reply to comments and view statistics on venue reviews. These features can be introduced with minimal changes in the app UI but future development including a venue timeline and the ability for patrons to make purchases in app will require a rework of the venue page.</p>

        <div id="Roles" class="tech_content_card">
            <span class="go_to_top"><a href="#top">↸ Back to top</a></span>
            <h1>Roles</h1>
            <p>In our initial development period, we have assigned team members to focus on specific functions of the application to maximize our development timeline. The roles were divided based on interest once we broke down the requirements of our Aim.</p>
            <h2>Rory- Project Manager and UI/UX Designer</h2>
            <p>Rory proposed the idea of the Pursuit of Hoppiness and has taken on the role of Project Manager. In this role he communicates the projects vision to the rest of the development team, manages work assignments and team meetings and manages the projects timeline.</p>
            <p>He has also taken on the role of UI/UX designer managing the branding, look, feel and flow of the app. </p>
            <h2>Gavin- Backend Product Manager and Developer</h2>
            <p>Gavin has some experience in Software and Database Programming as well as management of both Technical and Non-Technical Stakeholders.  Gavins role while contributing to development will be to manage the expectations of stakeholders with respect to scope creep, budget, and timelines.</p>
            <p>As this role is largely backend focused, it is also important to act to provide good service to the front end teams while maintaining security and performance in line with the vision of the project.</p>
            <h2>Kyle- Backend Developer</h2>
            <p>Kyle is one of our backend developers, ensuring that the code enabling the application for the Pursuit of Hoppiness functions properly and enables our users to use the application fluidly and without error. He works together with the rest of the backend developers so as to improve the application and our users experiences while using the application.</p>
            <p>Kyle contributes to the development of the application via things such as the integration of third-party API account creation and logins, password hashing, and the storage of new users data and account details - such as passwords, their email, and account ID.</p>
            <h2>Evan- Backend Developer - Database Manager</h2>
            <p>Evan is one of the team members primarily working on backend solutions for databases and data storage generally. He is thus responsible for helping ensure that any user data submitted and stored is done so safely and securely, while communicating with the other developers to ensure that they can quickly access or store data as they need.</p>

            <h1>Scope and Limitations</h1>
            <h2>Initial Scope for the Minimum Viable Product</h2>
            <p>There are 5 key criteria that are to be met for the product to be considered at the Minimum Viable Product Stage.  For simplification this will be listed in dot point form.</p>
            <p>Pursuit of Hoppiness must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be available on iOS.</li>
                <li>Allow login using existing Social Media credentials.  (Facebook, Google, etc.)</li>
                <li>Allow a user to view a venue in either list or map form</li>
                <li>Allow a user to view basic venue information(Opening hours, Cost guide, Beer selection)</li>
                <li>Allow a user to record information for a new product(beer)</li>
                <li>Allow a user to record a rating and a comment on an existing product</li>

            </ul>
            <p>These are the only goals for Phase 1.  The goals are limited to reduce scope creep and keep development costs and time low.</p>
            <p>Within these goals there are many sub items that themselves will be quite in depth.  The intention of this list is to provide a clear direction to the development team that these are the only main objectives that we should be working towards</p>

            <h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
            <h2>Back End</h2>
            <p class="draft_content">The assignment brief said that a description is not needed.  I feel a very small description better justifies the decisions.  Ill include a statement about the latest versions available at the start of development.</p>
            <p>Early planning of the stucture of the back end is crucial to the applications initial deployment and future success.  The SAS refers to it as the Seven Ps —Prior Planning and Preparation Prevents Piss Poor Performance— but in the tech industry it it is often called Technical Debt.  Decisions made in the early stages of development must be sound for the future of the product, however they must also be traded off against cost and expediency.</p>
            <p>As one major aim of the application is to have it scalable as demand and geographical footprint increases, we must aim to use technologies that will facilitate this.</p>
            <p>As a low cost start up, we must also aim to control costs at every turn.  To accompish this, where possible Free Open Source Software will be utilised.  Fortunately a lot of FOSS has become the industry standard for operations like this.</p>
            <h3>Ubuntu (https://ubuntu.com/)</h3>
            <p>Ubuntu linux is a widely supported and easier to learn linux distribution.  The latest versions are also supplied as a docker image.</p>
            <h3>Docker (https://www.docker.com/)</h3>
            <p>Docker is used to create not just individual virtual environments, but entire systems.  It runs on a variety of platforms and is very well supported across all cloud providers.</p>
            <h3>NGINX (https://www.nginx.com/)</h3>
            <p>NGINX will be used to direct requests to different docker containers based on the current requirements</p>
            <h3>gUNICORN (https://gunicorn.org/)</h3>
            <p>gUNICORN will be the production server for the main back end application built on Flask.</p>
            <h3>Flask (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)</h3>
            <p>Flask is a Python module that allows for back-end web scripting in Python. Flask can be used to create REST APIs. As the application must be available on a variety of platforms(iOS, Android, W3), the intention is to develop the backend to communicate almost exclusively with the outside world through a REST API.</p>
            <h3>PostgreSQL (https://www.postgresql.org/)</h3>
            <p>PostgreSQL is an open source database, with which Flask has a great extension for communication between the back-end application and the database.  </p>
            <h3>Python 3 (https://www.python.org/)</h3>
            <p>Python is an easy to learn programming language that is one of the most popular and in demand programming languages.  </p>
            <h3>OAuth 2.0</h3>
            <p>OAuth 2.0 is used to login and create accounts with our service using external websites such as Google, Twitter, and Facebook.</p>
            <h2>Front End</h2>
            <p class="draft_content">Found some stuff that will be useful for the front end while researching the maps API.</p>
            <p class="draft_content">(https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/cloud-setup) We would need an account with google cloud to anable billing for the use of maps above a certain usage. </p>
            <h2>External Sources</h2>
            <h3>Google Maps</h3>
            <p>Google maps is chosen over Apple maps even though initial deployment is planned for an iOS device.  This is because Google maps will provide an API for web based, android based, and iOS based applications which will allow for simplification of the product.</p>
            <h2>UI/UX</h2>
            <P>Development of the Apps UI and UX was Rory's Role. He has had design experience but has had no experience working with UI and UX development tools. After Research he settled on developing a prototype using Adobe XD. This was chosen due to its integration with the Adobe Creative Cloud Suite, which was already being used to develop design assets for the project. These Creative Cloud apps all required licensing through Adobe. The specific apps used where:<ul>
                <li>Adobe XD (Version 47.0.22)</li>
                <li>Adobe Photoshop (Version 23.01) </li>
                <li>Adobe Illustrator (Version 26.01) </li>
                <li>Adobe After Effects (Version 22.01) </li>
              </ul></P>
              <p>Additionally, Rory used Online Stock Library's to assist in asset creation, using premade Vectors and customizing them to fit with the apps style.<ul>

            <h1>Testing</h1>
            <p>Early product testing is to be conducted in three stages, similar to how any IT product is developed (https://www.kiwiqa.com/different-stages-of-game-testing/).  Initially, in house testing will be carried out to identify and rectify any major issues.  It is intended that this will be ongoing throughout development.  The second stage would be a "Closed Alpha" release to friends and family of the developers.  This idea is to get a larger cross section of users with different technical abilities that have not yet been exposed to the application.  Some bias could creep in to the closed alpha but it will still deliver good results.  Following a succesful Closed Alpha testing phase(There may be many) an open beta will be launched allowing for a larger pool of testers and a decreasing amount of bias.</p>
            <p>Unit testing for individual elements will be a requirement for a deliverable of any major section.  For this reason a dedicated Quality Assurance devloper will be employed to work alongside all developers to ensure that modules are robust and can fit within our Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery plan.</p>

            <h1>Timeframe</h1>
            <p>We are developing the Pursuit of Hoppiness in an unconventional way than to that of professionals, a product developed by a team of professionals would be developed sequentially, however we find ourselves developing everything at once.</p>
            <p>A sequential, standard development cycle from a professional team may look as such; First would come the analysis and planning stage, where the project is discussed and resources needed would be decided upon. Followed second would be both the UX and UI design, where designers work on the appearance of the application - things such as buttons, headers, logos are created. After this, the back-end developers would work on the functionality of the program, programming things such as database integration, cloud functionality and other relevant areas. Finally, the front-end developers would then take all these elements; the UI, UX, and Back-end code, and sculpt it all together to mold everything into the first stage of a functional product.</p>

            <p></p>

            <h2>Rory</h2>
            <p>Rory's role in the development of the Pursuit of Hoppiness is the UX and UI designer. He will work towards hitting two primary deadlines, being an active prototype in Week 5 of development and a working app that is fully integrated with other services by week 15.</p>
            <p>As there is a goal for an active prototype in Week 5 and UX development starting in week 3 the expected UX development cycle of 3-4 weeks and UI cycle of 2-3 weeks (https://existek.com/blog/app-development-timeline-how-long-does-it-take/ ) will be compacted into a total of three weeks, with tweaking and fine tuning happening after the production of the prototype.</p>

            <h2>Kyle</h2>
            <p>Kyle's role in the development of the Pursuit of Hoppiness is that of a backend developer. He will work on the things behind the scenes, such as the sign-up and account storage process.</p>

            <h1>Risks</h1>
            <h2>Cost Overun</h2>
            <p>Controlling costs in initial phases will allow us to commit more time to development activities.  One key expense point for a small organisation could be cloud fees.  These can be eliminated completely until they become a necessity. Utilising clever development of microservices on local machines before migrating the system to an IaaS provider will allow us to control costs significantly.</p>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <h3>API Key Storage</h3>
            <p>As the project relies on a number of external services such as Google Maps, we must take steps to keep our API keys safe.  An API key released into the wild could result in huge costs if not detected early or if measures arent taken to restrict the usage of the key.  (https://ozguralp.medium.com/unauthorized-google-maps-api-key-usage-cases-and-why-you-need-to-care-1ccb28bf21e).  Secret stores should be utilised to prevent any API keys being required to be embedded in code directly, and git Pre-Commit hooks should be utilised to prevent inadvertent publishing of secrets to repositories.</p>
            <h3>Password Storage</h3>
            <p>As an account is required to access and use The Pursuit of Hoppiness, there is always the risk of data breaches exposing user’s information to wrong doers. We plan to combat and prevent this in two ways; the first being passwords be inherently strong. They must meet the requirement of eight characters in length, while also containing at least one uppercase letter and special character.
The second action being the implementation of password <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26180_01/Platform.94/ATGPersProgGuide/html/s0506passwordhashing01.html" target="_blank">hashing.</a> Password hashing being a process in which passwords are transformed (hashed) from their initial states into a new string of letters and numbers. When logging into the website again, the password you enter is then hashed so as to match your intial password, compared to the hashed string in our database, and then approved or denied depending on whether the password is correct or not.</p>

            <h2>Complexity</h2>
            <p>Controlling complexity will be important.  An over complicated system will drive up costs by increasing security risk factors, development time, and technical debt.  We aim to control complexity by limiting development to small achievable goals and limiting as much scope creep as possible.  It may be prudent in some cases to extend development time to ensure that shortcuts are not taken that will lead to an increase in complexity of the system.</p>
            <h2>Ethical Risks</h2>
            <p>The Pursuit of Hoppiness is constructed as a social and fun community review app, however the apps focus around the consumption of alcohol introduces two Ethical considerations when discussing the user base.</p>
            <h3>Age Limit</h3>
            <p>In researching similar existing services and websites that featured alcohol multiple sites contained an age gate such as <a href="https://gageroads.com.au/">Gage Roads Brewing</a> which requires users to verify with a Yes or No and <a href="https://www.jimbeam.com/en-au/">Jim Beam</a> which requires users to enter their Date of Birth. Researching further I learned that this is not a legal requirement in America (Thomson, 2017) for websites featuring Alcohol. I was unable to find any sources that discussed whether it was or was not a legal requirement in Australia, so I assume it isn’t, however potential new laws will require Social Media sites, which The Pursuit of Hoppiness may fall under to take “All reasonable steps to verify” that users are over the age of 16 (Buckley, 2021).</p>
            <p>“All reasonable steps to verify” is vague however in in 2019 there was an Inquiry into age verification for online wagering and online pornography by the Australian Parliament which discussed multiple methods for online age verification. There where multiple suggestions for using existing government identification methods for this purpose including, existing government issued ID documents or the Trusted Digital Identity Framework, however these forms of identification also verify a user's identity which in our context is far more information than we need. There were also suggestions to use publicly available consumer information and databases, such as the Electoral Roll (which is something that Equifax said they do), which would only include individuals aged 18 and above, however again this introduces the issue of verifying a user's identity. Another solution presented was using a service such as <a href="https://yoti.world/age-scan/">Yoti Age Scan</a> which can identify a person's age by looking at their face in around 1 to 1 ½ seconds with an error rate of 0.31% when the threshold is set to 25 (Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, 2019). As there is currently no legal requirement to verify a user's age, these methods are currently not required.</p>
            <p>Asking for a user's Date of Birth also presents an issue as it classifies as Personally Identifiable Information and there have been cases of Apps being blocked from the Apple App Store for asking for this information (Age Restrictions on Apps | Apple Developer Forums, 2016).</p>
            <p>Despite there currently not being any legal requirement to do so having users verify their age seems to be best practice. With this information in mind, when creating a profile in our app users will be required to select yes or no to the prompt are you over 18. If the user selects no they will be directed to the <a href="https://drinkwise.org.au/under-18s/age-gate-restrictions/?fbclid=IwAR0DhxvJdUrtWdyPKh8Rjy7-tZ4ltIA-6RPk7VU791UjBMofgD37dUGuSr4#">DrinkWise Landing Page</a> which can direct underage users to more resources.</p>
            <h3>Alcohol Consumption</h3>
            <p>Pursuit of Hoppiness focuses on the Craft market and social aspects of drinking, however it would be irresponsible to ignore the potential health risks to creating an app that encourages and promotes the consumption of alcohol.</p>
            <p>Short term health risks of alcohol consumption include Injuries, drowning, motor vehicle crashes, violence, alcohol poisoning and risky sexual behavior and long-term risks include increased risk of cancer, high blood pressure, weakening of the immune system and social issues (Drinking too much alcohol can harm your health. Learn the facts | CDC, 2021). To mitigate these risks the Australian Government recommends no more than 4 Standard Drinks in one day and no more than 10 standard drinks in a week (Managing your alcohol intake, 2020). </p>
            <p>Addition of common safe drinking slogans, such as “Drink Responsibly” and “Know you limit” can be scattered around the app to help provide subtle reminders to users. Additionally, linking to resources such as <a href="https://drinkwise.org.au/">DrinkWise</a> in the main menu can provide awareness and support.</p>
            <p>To further support safe drinking behaviors the app could feature low and non-alcoholic beverages which is a quickly growing industry. In 2020 the share of no and low alcohol beer, wine and spirits incandesced to 3% of the total beverage market with an expected 31% growth of the nonalcoholic industry by 2024 (IWSR Drinks Market Analysis, 2021). The sales of Non-Alcoholic Drinks at BWS and Dan Murphys’ almost doubling over the last 12 months (Brescia, 2021). Promoting these beers encourages their consumption and helps reconstruct current social norms which result in 35% of 18-44 year old's saying they would hide low or lower strength alcohol products while drinking socially (Zero, low and mid-strength alcohol – Australian consumers’ prevalence, practices and attitudes, 2021).</p>

            <h1>Group processes and communications</h1>
            <p>Our Team is scattered across Australia working in different time zones with different work, personal and school commitments. To best facilitate communication and collaboration we use a variety of cloud based synchronous and asynchronous Tools.</p>

            <h2>Microsoft Teams</h2>
            <p>As no member of the current team lives within 700 km of the other, it is important that we use some online tools to enable collaboration</p>
            <p>For general colloboration the Office 365 suite is selected as it is an industry standard and offers more interoperability with external vendors than the offerings from the nearest competitor, Google.</p>
            <p>Microsoft teams in the backbone of our communication. We have a weekly recuring full team meeting where each member presents updates on their progress, discusses agenda items, and plans for future developments. From these meetings we can schedule additional calls as required as a full team or in smaller breakout groups. These form our primary synchronous communication.</p>
            <p>During meetings we apply proven team communication strategies including, being inclusive, hearing from all members of the team, being clear and showing respect (https://www.cio.com/article/238521/6-proven-project-team-communication-strategies-2.html).</p>
            <p>If a group member is unable to attend a meeting they respond to the invitation or Teams Discussion with a reason ahead of the meeting. The meetings, Agenda Items and Actions are recorded from these sessions, so members are still able to track progress and continue developing.</p>
            <p>Teams also support asynchronous communications though channel posts, allowing users to post a new discussion items, or comment on an existing discussions as they can.</p>
            <p>Other tools built into Teams, such as SharePoint and lists are also used regularly to support collaborative work and organization.</p>


            <h2>GitHub</h2>
            <p>GitHub is another tool that we use as part of our process. We use GitHub as the repository as we develop our application. It allows multiple users to work together and build on the work of others. We also make use of the Summary, Description, and comment features on commits to provide further insight to other team members work.</p>
            <p>For code storage and development, a Github Organization account will be used to store code and manage issues and deployments.  Github is chosen over any other self hosted applications as it offers the most features and most users will be familiar with its use.</p>

            <h2>Other Tools</h2>
            <p>All official communication is contained through these applications, but other communication platforms, such as Facebook messenger and Discord are used for more casual check-ins and to chase members if they are running late to a meeting.</p>
