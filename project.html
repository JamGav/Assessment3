            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <h2>Topic</h2>
            <p>Pursuit of Hoppiness is a community sourced bar rating and review app that can be used to filter by specific categories to allow beer enthusiasts to broaden their beer horizons, beer bargain hunters to find and deal, and all beer lovers to come together in one place. It is the “Pursuit of Hoppiness”.</p>
            <p>The app focus on reviews of venues and encourages exploration of a user's local area or can serve as a guide when you arrive somewhere new providing 5 different beer focused categories to filter by instead of a single unrelated 5-star review.</p>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>Beer is the most consumed alcoholic beverage in the world and third most popular beverage after water and tea (S <https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/8/11/1382/htm). Despite an overall drop in Australian beer consumption the craft beer industryhas grown 4.7% annually between 2016 and 2021 with a 6.2% expected growth to occur in 2021 (https://www.ibisworld.com/au/industry/craft-beer-production/5071/>). Despite this when I explore new bars I find the same 4 lager taps installed. “Pursuit of Hoppiness” solves this by quickly sorting all nearby venues based on Tap Uniqueness,  Total Taps, Pint Price, and Atmosphere based on fellow beer enthusiast's input. The app also allows reviews and social networking with friends.</p>

            <h2>Landscape</h2>
            <p>38% of Craft Beer drinkers in Australia use beer apps (https://www.beercartel.com.au/blog/2016-australian-craft-beer-survey-results/ ), equating to a large market and many competitors. There are many similar applications on the market, but the use of our 5 categories of venue filtering, 6 including distance and social elements, brings something new not offered by others in the space.</p>
            <p>Untappd is the largest existing competitor in the market. They are a craft beer review app on IOS and Android with a social element. The app allows users to check into venues, try and review beers, tagging them to that specific location (https://untappd.com/home). The app had 8 million users, 900 million venue check-ins and 20,000 businesses mid 2020 (https://expandedramblings.com/index.php/untappd-statistics-facts/). Similarities between our concept and their product include the map UI, social elements, and badges. However, our concept differs with their product exclusively focused on reviews of Beers, whereas ours will focus on review of venues. </p>
            <p>Untappd's business model charges bars and breweries an annual fee for membership, providing them features including digital and print menu web-based design applications and hosting, access to specific customer groups, event marketing, push/email marketing, social media integrations, and access to a beer database. There are other apps that use the same model, including Barmenus (https://www.beermenus.com/blog/312-untappd-for-business-price-increase). Giving bar owners control of their location is a feature we are planning to include, but we had not considered monetizing this feature.</p>
            <p>The app MisterGoodBeer- find your bar, is another product on the market with similarities to the Pursuit of Hoppinses. It shows nearby locations and can be filtered by price, and happy hour. Contributions to the App are made by the users. The app has over 151,000 downloads and 12,400 contributors (https://www.mistergoodbeer.com/). The app features a similar UI and venue focus but lacks the social element that we plan to bring.</p>

            <h2>Back End</h2>
            <p class="draft_content">The assignment brief said that a description is not needed.  I feel a very small description better justifies the decisions.  Ill include a statement about the latest versions available at the start of development.</p>
            <p>Early planning of the stucture of the back end is crucial to the applications initial deployment and future success.  The SAS refers to it as the Seven Ps —Prior Planning and Preparation Prevents Piss Poor Performance— but in the tech industry it it is often called Technical Debt.  Decisions made in the early stages of development must be sound for the future of the product, however they must also be traded off against cost and expediency.</p>
            <p>As one major aim of the application is to have it scalable as demand and geographical footprint increases, we must aim to use technologies that will facilitate this.</p>
            <p>As a low cost start up, we must also aim to control costs at every turn.  To accompish this, where possible Free Open Source Software will be utilised.  Fortunately a lot of FOSS has become the industry standard for operations like this.</p>
            <h3>Ubuntu (https://ubuntu.com/)</h3>
            <p>Ubuntu linux is a widely supported and easier to learn linux distribution.  The latest versions are also supplied as a docker image.</p>
            <h3>Docker (https://www.docker.com/)</h3>
            <p>Docker is used to create not just individual virtual environments, but entire systems.  It runs on a variety of platforms and is very well supported across all cloud providers.</p>
            <h3>NGINX (https://www.nginx.com/)</h3>
            <p>NGINX will be used to direct requests to different docker containers based on the current requirements</p>
            <h3>gUNICORN (https://gunicorn.org/)</h3>
            <p>gUNICORN will be the production server for the main back end application built on flask.</p>
            <h3>Flask (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)</h3>
            <p>Flask is a python module that allows for back end web scripting in Python. Flask can be used to create RestfAPIs. As the application must be available on a variety of platforms(iOS, Android, W3), the intention is to develop the backend to communicate almost exclusively with the outside world through a rest API</p>
            <h3>Postgres DB (https://www.postgresql.org/)</h3>
            <p>Postgres is an open source database that for which Flask has a great extension for communication between the back end application and the database.  </p>
            <h3>Python 3 (https://www.python.org/)</h3>
            <p>Python is an easy to learn programming language that is one of the most popular and in demand programming languages.  </p>

            <h1>Testing</h1>
            <p>Early product testing is to be conducted in three stages.  Initially, in house testing will be carried out to identify and rectify any major issues.  It is intended that this will be ongoing throughout development.  The second stage would be a "Closed Alpha" release to friends and family of the developers.  This idea is to get a larger cross section of users with different technical abilities that have not yet been exposed to the application.  Some bias could creep in to the closed alpha but it will still deliver good results.  Following a succesful Closed Alpha testing phase(There may be many) an open beta will be launched allowing for a larger pool of testers and a decreasing amount of bias.</p>

            <h1>Group processes and communications</h1>
            <p>Our Team is scattered across Australia working in different time zones with different work, personal and school commitments. To best facilitate communication and collaboration we use a variety of cloud based synchronous and asynchronous Tools.</p>

            <h2>Microsoft Teams</h2>
            <p>Microsoft teams in the backbone of our communication. We have a weekly recuring full team meeting where each member presents updates on their progress, discusses agenda items, and plans for future developments. From these meetings we can schedule additional calls as required as a full team or in smaller breakout groups. These form our primary synchronous communication.</p>
            <p>During meetings we apply proven team communication strategies including, being inclusive, hearing from all members of the team, being clear and showing respect (https://www.cio.com/article/238521/6-proven-project-team-communication-strategies-2.html).</p>
            <p>If a group member is unable to attend a meeting they respond to the invitation or Teams Discussion with a reason ahead of the meeting. The meetings, Agenda Items and Actions are recorded from these sessions, so members are still able to track progress and continue developing.</p>
            <p>Teams also support asynchronous communications though channel posts, allowing users to post a new discussion items, or comment on an existing discussions as they can.</p>
            <p>Other tools built into Teams, such as SharePoint and lists are also used regularly to support collaborative work and organization.</p>

            <h2>GitHub</h2>
            <p>GitHub is another tool that we use as part of our process. We use GitHub as the repository as we develop our application. It allows multiple users to work together and build on the work of others. We also make use of the Summary, Description, and comment features on commits to provide further insight to other team members work.</p>

            <h2>Other Tools</h2>
            <p>All official communication is contained through these applications, but other communication platforms, such as Facebook messenger and Discord are used for more casual check-ins and to chase members if they are running late to a meeting.</p>
