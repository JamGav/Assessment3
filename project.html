        <p>Pursuit of Hoppiness is a community sourced bar rating and review app that can be used to filter by specific categories to allow beer enthusiasts to broaden their beer horizons, beer bargain hunters to find a deal, and all beer lovers to come together in one place. It is the “Pursuit of Hoppiness”.</p>
        <p>The app focus on reviews of venues and encourages exploration of a user's local area or can serve as a guide when you arrive somewhere new providing 5 different beer focused categories to filter by instead of a single unrelated 5-star review. These 5 categories are Tap Uniqueness, Total Taps, Pint Price, and Atmosphere all based on fellow beer enthusiast's input. The app also allows reviews and social networking with friends.</p>
        <p>To read more about the initial concept for the Pursuit of Hoppiness please <a href="https://roryjhenderson.github.io/Task-1-My-Profile/Project_Idea.html">Click Here</a>. </p>
        <p>Following consultation with fellow beer fans from the Sharper Tech Group, input form Tim Lo and other interested parties here are our considerations for additional features and future development strategies. </p>

        <H3>Owner comments and administration</H3>

        <p>Similar to google business’ layout the app will give bar owners the option to certify ownership of the bars name, provide a brief description comment and comment on app user reviews.</p>
        <p>A basic process of authentication will be necessary for the bar owner to prove their ownership that will grant them access to modify their bars page, sufficient documentation to prove their ownership such as an ABN registry letter or letter from their accountant. Once this is processed the owner is granted administration access to their business’ page giving them the ability to provide a brief 50-word description of the bars overall theme and vibe, style of music and entertainment, general audience description, any entry fee, trading hours, happy hour and any other special offers.
        Bar owners will receive notifications through the app (and possibly email) on interaction statistics e.g., positive/negative reviews, increase or decrease in their 5-star rating, how many app users are visiting their business, they can also choose to reply to user reviews of their bar and craft beer service.</p>

        <H3>Linking external services</H3>
        <p>We would design the UI to intergrade links to external apps for navigation, bookings, and purchases to improve accessibility and provide a more user-friendly experience.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Linking the app to google map services so that users can search for unfamiliar bars in their local area, find the best route to their bar of interest or plan an afternoon/evening of bar hoping around craft beer bars in the same area.</li>
        <li>Each bar that required bookings would have an external link on the bars page to OpenTable so the user could book a table.</li>
        <li>If any of the bars on the app were to brew their own craft beers or sell other merchandise (t-shirts, stubbie holders, coasters etc.) then a link to their website could be provided through the bars profile.</li>
        </ul>
