            <p>Pursuit of Hoppiness is a community sourced bar rating and review app that can be used to filter by specific categories to allow beer enthusiasts to broaden their beer horizons, beer bargain hunters to find a deal, and all beer lovers to come together in one place. It is the “Pursuit of Hoppiness”.</p>
            <p>The app focus on reviews of venues and encourages exploration of a user's local area or can serve as a guide when you arrive somewhere new providing 5 different beer focused categories to filter by instead of a single unrelated 5-star review. These 5 categories are Tap Uniqueness, Total Taps, Pint Price, and Atmosphere all based on fellow beer enthusiast's input. The app also allows reviews and social networking with friends.</p>
            <p>To read more about the initial concept for the Pursuit of Hoppiness please <a href="https://roryjhenderson.github.io/Task-1-My-Profile/Project_Idea.html">Click Here</a>. </p>
            <p>Following consultation with fellow beer fans from the Sharper Tech Group, input form Tim Lo and other interested parties here are our considerations for additional features and future development strategies. </p>

            <H3>Owner comments and administration</H3>
            <p>Similar to google business’ layout the app will give bar owners the option to certify ownership of the bars name, provide a brief description comment and comment on app user reviews.</p>
            <p>A basic process of authentication will be necessary for the bar owner to prove their ownership that will grant them access to modify their bars page, sufficient documentation to prove their ownership such as an ABN registry letter or letter from their accountant. Once this is processed the owner is granted administration access to their business’ page giving them the ability to provide a brief 50-word description of the bars overall theme and vibe, style of music and entertainment, general audience description, any entry fee, trading hours, happy hour and any other special offers.  Bar owners will receive notifications through the app (and possibly email) on interaction statistics e.g., positive/negative reviews, increase or decrease in their 5-star rating, how many app users are visiting their business, they can also choose to reply to user reviews of their bar and craft beer service.</p>
            <p>While Pursuit of Hoppiness appears to be mostly consumer facing on the surface, the business facing side of the application can not be understated. The technologies used in Pursuit of Hoppiness allow considerable analytics to be provided to businesses that sign up to access the data. Analytics services could be provided or even access to integrate into their own systems using the REST API.  For example, popular analytics platforms like Jaspersoft or PowerBI can accept a RESTful datasource.</p>
            <P>Some examples of the data that can be collected by the application that may not be immediately obvious:</P>
            <ul>
                <li>Time of use</li>
                <li>Location of use</li>
                <li>Search criteria when looking for a venue</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data can be used by the business to build a detailed profile of the customers that they are attracting which can be used to make better business decisions.</p>
            <H3>Linking external services</H3>
            <p>We would design the UI to intergrate links to external apps for navigation, bookings, and purchases to improve accessibility and provide a more user-friendly experience.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Linking the app to google map services so that users can search for unfamiliar bars in their local area, find the best route to their bar of interest or plan an afternoon/evening of bar hoping around craft beer bars in the same area.</li>
                <li>Each bar that required bookings would have an external link on the bars page to OpenTable so the user could book a table.</li>
                <li>If any of the bars on the app were to brew their own craft beers or sell merchandise (t-shirts, stubbie holders, coasters etc.) then a link to their website could be provided through the bars profile.</li>
            </ul>
            

            <H2>Tools and Technology</H2>
            <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
            <p>Initially a proof of concept application would be self hosted. Self hosting in the early phases offers a significant cost saving over using a cloud service(Website Planet, 2019).  While a rented VPS may actually be in someone elses cloud, it will still behave as if it was a discrete computer rather than a cloud platform.  After the proof of concept and initial local area public releases, a migration to a cloud hosted environment will offer better reliability and provide for the service to be distributed with lower latency to various population centres. With a planned migration to the cloud following succesful trials, development from the beginning must be cloud focused to reduce complexity during the cutover.</p>
            <h3>Back end</h3>
            <h4>Database</h4>
            <p>A PostgreSQL database is the most likely selection for the database side of a backend. PostgreSQL is free and open source, with a wide community backing. These two points alone make it a very good choice. An alternative would be a MySQL database. MySQL offers a lower barrier to entry in regards to skills an knowledge required for setup but as the application needs to scale up or even change direction MySQL may not be able to provide the same in demand features of a PostgreSQL system.</p>
            <h4>REST API</h4>
            <p>A rest API will be the primary interface for the database with the rest of the world. Using a Rest API will allow for backend to be completely separated from front end and allow the product to be platform agnostic. This means that development for different platforms can take place concurrently and more rapidly as the human interfaces will not have to be developed individually to get the data requred.  Alternative technologies such as SOAP increase the complexity of the API for no appreciable benefit.</p>
            <h3>Front End</h3>
            <p>As this is a mostly consumer facing product, the interface with humans is a very important part. Pursuit of Hoppiness is intended to be used on the go which makes mobile development a key area for development. iOS holds a slightly higher market share amongst the Australian market(StatCounter Global Stats, 2019). To reduce initial cost for development and to reach the largest segment of the market possible with a trial, iOS is the chosen platform for the initial mobile development. Further research would have to be conducted to understand if the overall statistics for mobile OS market share translates to the products target demographic.</p>
            <h3>Reasoning for iOS Development</h3>
            <p>The reasoning to why we plan to develop and release the application for iOS based devices has been decided per the knowledge of Apple holding the market majority of phones in Australia, with reports being that 56.7% of phones are that of Apple's (StatCounter Global Stats, 2019). Developing for this market before then expanding into Android development allows for lower developmental time and costs, while still allowing us to reach the largest audience available.</p>
            <h3>Payment via the application</h3>
            <p>Through this iOS application we plan to integrate payment applications such as Apple pay as well as Google pay through a tap or scan of a QR code. At a later date, we'd also like to explore the option of allowing users to store their cards payment details directly into the application. We believe that by allowing users to pay for their drinks through the application, it will promote the product to the owners of bars that which aren't signed up to then sign up. By keeping the payments inside the ecosystem of our own application, we would like to develop it so that there is no need to leave the application when ordering drinks at these bars.</p>
            <h3>Profiles</h3>
            <p>Users can choose to list their favourite bars and places to drink as well as what their go-to drinks would be. Also listed on these profiles would be the users favourite spirits, beers or wines.</p>
            <h2>Required Skills</h2>
            <p>Over the lifespan of Pursuit of Hoppiness the required skills is anticipated to shift. In the early phases of development the main technical skills can be grouped into two areas, front end and back end.</p>
            <p>The front end area must possess the following technical skills</p>
            <ul>
                <li>iOS development</li>
                <li>Rest API usage</li>
                <li>Web development</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The back end area must possess the following technical skills</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Database development</li>
                <li>Rest API development</li>
                <li>Cloud configuration</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition to the technical skills it is important that all team members are able to work effectively in a team and can take responsibility for their own deliverables.</p>
            <p>As the development progresses into the trial phase, the product will have to be marketed. This is something that can be outsourced to a third party or alternatively conducted in house depending on budgets.  As no team members possess any skills in this area, outsourcing the work to a dedicated entity makes a lot of sense.</p>
           
            <H3>Ethical Considerations</H3>
            <p>The Pursuit of Hoppiness is constructed as a social and fun community review app, however the apps focus around the consumption of alcohol introduces two Ethical considerations when discussing the user base.</p>
            <h4>Age Limit</h4>
            <p>In researching similar existing services and websites that featured alcohol multiple sites contained an age gate such as <a href="https://gageroads.com.au/">Gage Roads Brewing</a> which requires users to verify with a Yes or No and <a href="https://www.jimbeam.com/en-au/">Jim Beam</a> which requires users to enter their Date of Birth. Researching further I learned that this is not a legal requirement in America (Thomson, 2017) for websites featuring Alcohol. I was unable to find any sources that discussed whether it was or was not a legal requirement in Australia, so I assume it isn’t, however potential new laws will require Social Media sites, which The Pursuit of Hoppiness may fall under to take “All reasonable steps to verify” that users are over the age of 16 (Buckley, 2021).</p>
            <p>“All reasonable steps to verify” is vague however in in 2019 there was an Inquiry into age verification for online wagering and online pornography by the Australian Parliament which discussed multiple methods for online age verification. There where multiple suggestions for using existing government identification methods for this purpose including, existing government issued ID documents or the Trusted Digital Identity Framework, however these forms of identification also verify a user's identity which in our context is far more information than we need. There were also suggestions to use publicly available consumer information and databases, such as the Electoral Roll (which is something that Equifax said they do), which would only include individuals aged 18 and above, however again this introduces the issue of verifying a user's identity. Another solution presented was using a service such as <a href="https://yoti.world/age-scan/">Yoti Age Scan</a> which can identify a person's age by looking at their face in around 1 to 1 ½ seconds with an error rate of 0.31% when the threshold is set to 25 (Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, 2019). As there is currently no legal requirement to verify a user's age, these methods are currently not required.</p>
            <p>Asking for a user's Date of Birth also presents an issue as it classifies as Personally Identifiable Information and there have been cases of Apps being blocked from the Apple App Store for asking for this information (Age Restrictions on Apps | Apple Developer Forums, 2016).</p>
            <p>Despite there currently not being any legal requirement to do so having users verify their age seems to be best practice. With this information in mind, when creating a profile in our app users will be required to select yes or no to the prompt are you over 18. If the user selects no they will be directed to the <a href="https://drinkwise.org.au/under-18s/age-gate-restrictions/?fbclid=IwAR0DhxvJdUrtWdyPKh8Rjy7-tZ4ltIA-6RPk7VU791UjBMofgD37dUGuSr4#">DrinkWise Landing Page</a> which can direct underage users to more resources.</p>
            <h4>Alcohol Consumption</h4>
            <p>Pursuit of Hoppiness focuses on the Craft market and social aspects of drinking, however it would be irresponsible to ignore the potential health risks to creating an app that encourages and promotes the consumption of alcohol.</p>
            <p>Short term health risks of alcohol consumption include Injuries, drowning, motor vehicle crashes, violence, alcohol poisoning and risky sexual behavior and long-term risks include increased risk of cancer, high blood pressure, weakening of the immune system and social issues (Drinking too much alcohol can harm your health. Learn the facts | CDC, 2021). To mitigate these risks the Australian Government recommends no more than 4 Standard Drinks in one day and no more than 10 standard drinks in a week (Managing your alcohol intake, 2020). </p>
            <p>Addition of common safe drinking slogans, such as “Drink Responsibly” and “Know you limit” can be scattered around the app to help provide subtle reminders to users. Additionally, linking to resources such as <a href="https://drinkwise.org.au/">DrinkWise</a> in the main menu can provide awareness and support.</p>
            <p>To further support safe drinking behaviors the app could feature low and non-alcoholic beverages which is a quickly growing industry. In 2020 the share of no and low alcohol beer, wine and spirits incandesced to 3% of the total beverage market with an expected 31% growth of the nonalcoholic industry by 2024 (IWSR Drinks Market Analysis, 2021). The sales of Non-Alcoholic Drinks at BWS and Dan Murphys’ almost doubling over the last 12 months (Brescia, 2021). Promoting these beers encourages their consumption and helps reconstruct current social norms which result in 35% of 18-44 year old's saying they would hide low or lower strength alcohol products while drinking socially (Zero, low and mid-strength alcohol – Australian consumers’ prevalence, practices and attitudes, 2021).</p>
